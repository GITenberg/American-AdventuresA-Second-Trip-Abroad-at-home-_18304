<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>Though much has been written of the South, it
seems to me that this part of our country is less understood
than any other part. Certainly the South, itself,
feels that this is true. Its relationship to the North
makes me think of nothing so much as that of a pretty,
sensitive wife, to a big, strong, amiable, if somewhat
thick-skinned husband. These two had one great
quarrel which nearly resulted in divorce. He thought
her headstrong; she thought him overbearing. The
quarrel made her ill; she has been for some time recovering.
But though they have settled their difficulties and
are living again in amity together, and though he, man-like,
has half forgotten that they ever quarreled at all,
now that peace reigns in the house again, <i>she</i> has <i>not</i>
forgotten. There still lingers in her mind the feeling
that he never really understood her, that he never understood
her problems and her struggles, and that he
never will. And it seems to me further that, as is
usually the case with wives who consider themselves misunderstood,
the fault is partly, but by no means altogether,
hers. He, upon one hand, is inclined to pass the
matter off with a: "There, there! It's all over now.
Just be good and forget it!" while she, in the depths of
her heart, retains a little bit of wistfulness, a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
wounded feeling, which causes her to say to herself:
"Thank God our home was not broken up, but&mdash;I wish
that he could be a little more considerate, sometimes, in
view of all that I have suffered."</p>

<p>For my part, I am the humble but devoted friend of
the family. Having known him first, having been from
boyhood his companion, I may perhaps have sympathized
with him in the beginning. But since I have
come to know her, too, that is no longer so. And I
do think I know her&mdash;proud, sensitive, high-strung,
generous, captivating beauty that she is! Moreover,
after the fashion of many another "friend of the
family," I have fallen in love with her. Loving her
from afar, I send her as a nosegay these chapters gathered
in her own gardens. If some of the flowers are of
a kind for which she does not care, if some have thorns,
even if some are only weeds, I pray her to remember
that from what was growing in her gardens I was forced
to make my choice, and to believe that, whatever the defects
of my bouquet, it is meant to be a bunch of roses.</p>

<p>Had my companion and I never crossed the continent
together, had we never gone "abroad at
home," I might have curbed my impatience at
the beginning of our second voyage. But from the
time we returned from our first journey, after having
spent some months in trying, as some one put it,
to "discover America," I felt the gnawings of excited
appetite. The vast sweep of the country continually
suggested to me some great delectable repast: a banquet
spread for a hundred million guests; and having
discovered myself unable, in the time first allotted, to devour
more than part of it&mdash;a strip across the table, as
it were, stretching from New York on one side to San
Francisco on the other&mdash;I have hungered impatiently
for more. Indeed, to be quite honest, I should like to
try to eat it all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Months before our actual departure for the South
the day for leaving was appointed; days before we fixed
upon our train; hours before I bought my ticket. And
then, when my trunks had left the house, when my taxicab
was ordered and my faithful battered suitcase
stood packed to bulging in the hall, my companion, the
Illustrator, telephoned to say that certain drawings he
must finish before leaving were not done, that he would
be unable to go with me that afternoon, as planned, but
must wait until the midnight train.</p>

<p>Had the first leap been a long one I should have waited
for him, but the distance from New York to the other
side of Mason and Dixon's Line is short, and I knew
that he would join me on the threshold of the South next
morning. Therefore I told him I would leave that afternoon
as originally proposed, and gave him, in excuse,
every reason I could think of, save the real one: namely,
my impatience. I told him that I wished to make the
initial trip by day to avoid the discomforts of the sleeping
car, that I had engaged hotel accommodations for the
night by wire, that friends were coming down to see me
off.</p>

<p>Nor were these arguments without truth. I believe
in telling the truth. The truth is good enough for
any one at any time&mdash;except, perhaps, when there is a
point to be carried, and even then some vestige of it
should, if convenient, be preserved. Thus, for example,
it is quite true that I prefer the conversation of my fellow
travelers, dull though it may be, to the stertorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sounds they make by night; so, too, if I had not telegraphed
for rooms, it was merely because I had forgotten
to&mdash;and that I remedied immediately; while as to
the statement that friends were to see me off, that was
absolutely and literally accurate. Friends had, indeed,
signified their purpose to meet me at the station for last
farewells, and had, furthermore, remarked upon the very
slight show of enthusiasm with which I heard the news.</p>

<p>The fact is, I do not like to be seen off. Least of all,
do I like to be seen off by those who are dear to me.
If the thing must be done, I prefer it to be done by
strangers&mdash;committees from chambers of commerce and
the like, who have no interest in me save the hope that I
will live to write agreeably of their city&mdash;of the civic
center, the fertilizer works, and the charming new abattoir.
Seeing me off for the most practical of reasons,
such gentlemen are invariably efficient. They provide
an equipage, and there have even been times when, in
the final hurried moments, they have helped me to jam
the last things into my trunks and bags. One of them
politely takes my suitcase, another kindly checks my
baggage, and all in order that a third, who is usually the
secretary of the chamber of commerce, may regale me
with inspiring statistics concerning the population of
"our city," the seating capacity of the auditorium, the
number of banks, the amount of their clearings, and the
quantity of belt buckles annually manufactured. When
the train is ready we exchange polite expressions of regret
at parting: expressions reminiscent of those little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
speeches which the King of England and the Emperor
of Germany used to make at parting in the old days before
they found each other out and began dropping
high explosives on each other's roofs.</p>

<p>Such a committee, feeling no emotion (except perhaps
relief) at seeing me depart, may be useful. Not so with
friends and loved ones. Useful as they may be in the
great crises of life, they are but disturbing elements in
the small ones. Those who would die for us seldom
check our trunks.</p>

<p>By this I do not mean to imply that either of the two
delightful creatures who came to the Pennsylvania
Terminal to bid me good-by would die for me. That
one has lived for me and that both attempt to regulate
my conduct is more than enough. Hardly had I alighted
from my taxicab, hardly had the redcap seized my suitcase,
when, with sweet smiles and a twinkling of daintily
shod feet, they came. Fancy their having arrived ahead
of me! Fancy their having come like a pair of angels
through the rain to see me off! Enough to turn a man's
head! It did turn mine; and I noticed that, as they approached,
the heads of other men were turning too.</p>

<p>Flattered to befuddlement, I greeted them and started
with them automatically in the direction of the concourse,
forgetting entirely the driver of my taxicab, who,
however, took in the situation and set up a great shout&mdash;whereat
I returned hastily and overpaid him.</p>

<p>This accomplished, I rejoined my companions and,
with a radiant dark-haired girl at one elbow and a blonde,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
equally delectable, at the other, moved across the concourse.</p>

<p>How gay they were as we strolled along! How amusing
were their prophecies of adventures destined to befall
me in the South. Small wonder that I took no
thought of whither I was going.</p>

<p>Presently, having reached the wall at the other side
of the great vaulted chamber, we stopped.</p>

<p>"Which train, boss?" asked the porter who had meekly
followed.</p>

<p>Train? I had forgotten about trains. The mention
of the subject distracted my attention for the moment
from the <i>Loreleien</i>, stirred my drugged sense of duty,
and reminded me that I had trunks to check.</p>

<p>My suggestion that I leave them briefly for this purpose
was lightly brushed aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" they cried. "We shall go with you."</p>

<p>I gave in at once&mdash;one always does with them&mdash;and inquired
of the porter the location of the baggage room.
He looked somewhat fatigued as he replied:</p>

<p>"It's away back there where we come from, boss."</p>

<p>It was a long walk; in a garden, with no train to
catch, it would have been delightful.</p>

<p>"Got your tickets?" suggested the porter as we passed
the row of grilled windows. He had evidently concluded
that I was irresponsible.</p>

<p>As I had them, we continued on our way, and presently
achieved the baggage room, where they stood talking
and laughing, telling me of the morning's shopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
expedition&mdash;hat-hunting, they called it&mdash;in the rain. I
fancy that we might have been there yet had not a baggageman,
perhaps divining that I had become a little bit
distrait and that I had business to transact, rapped
smartly on the iron counter with his punch and demanded:</p>

<p>"Baggage checked?"</p>

<p>Turning, not without reluctance, from a pair of violet
eyes and a pair of the most mysterious gray, I began
to fumble in my pockets for the claim checks.</p>

<p>"How long shall you stay in Baltimore?" asked the
girl with the gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" I answered, still searching for the
checks.</p>

<p>"That doesn't make sense," remarked the blue-eyed
girl as I found the checks and handed them to the baggageman.
"She asked how long you'd stay in Baltimore,
and you said: 'Yes, indeed.'"</p>

<p>"About a week I meant to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe a week will be enough," said Gray-eyes.</p>

<p>"We can't stay longer," I declared. "We must keep
pushing on. There are so many places in the South to
see."</p>

<p>"My sister has just been there, and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where to?" demanded the insistent baggageman.</p>

<p>"Why, Baltimore, of course," I said. Had he paid
attention to our conversation he might have known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were saying," reminded Violet-eyes, "that your
sister&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"She just came home from there, and says that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Railroad ticket!" said the baggageman with exaggerated
patience.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Railroad ticket!&quot; said the baggageman with exaggerated patience. I began to feel in various pockets</span>
</div>

<p>I began again to feel in various pockets.</p>

<p>"She says," continued Gray-eyes, "that she never met
more charming people or had better things to eat. She
loves the southern accent too."</p>

<p>I don't know how the tickets got into my upper right
vest pocket; I never carry tickets there; but that is
where I found them.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" asked the other girl of me.</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the southern accent."</p>

<p>"Any valuation?" the baggageman demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered them both at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>do</i>?" cried Violet-eyes, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put down the amount and sign here," the baggageman
directed, pushing a slip toward me and placing a
pencil in my hand.</p>

<p>I obeyed. The baggageman took the slip and went off
to a little desk. I judged that he had finished with me
for the moment.</p>

<p>"But don't you think," my fair inquisitor continued,
"that the southern girls pile on the accent awfully, because
they know it pleases men?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," I said. "But then, what better reason
could they have for doing so?"</p>

<p>"Listen to that!" she cried to her companion. "Did
you ever hear such egotism?"</p>

<p>"He's nothing but a man," said Gray-eyes scornfully.
"I wouldn't be a man for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dollar and eighty-five cents," declared the baggageman.</p>

<p>I paid him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be a man for anything!" my fair friend
finished as we started to move off.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have you one," I told her, opening the
concourse door.</p>

<p>"<i>Hay!</i>" shouted the baggageman. "Here's your
ticket and your checks!"</p>

<p>I returned, took them, and put them in my pocket.
Again we proceeded upon our way. I was glad to leave
the baggageman.</p>

<p>This time the porter meant to take no chances.</p>

<p>"What train, boss?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Congressional Limited."</p>

<p>"You got jus' four minutes."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Gray-eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought," said Violet-eyes as we accelerated our
pace, "that you prided yourself on always having time
to spare?"</p>

<p>"Usually I do," I answered, "but in this case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What car?" the porter interrupted tactfully.</p>

<p>Again I felt for my tickets. This time they were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
my change pocket. I can't imagine how I came to put
them there.</p>

<p>"But in this case&mdash;<i>what</i>?" The violet eyes looked
threatening as their owner put the question.</p>

<p>"Seat seven, car three," I told the porter firmly as we
approached the gate. Then, turning to my dangerous
and lovely cross-examiner: "In this case I am unfortunate,
for there is barely time to say good-by."</p>

<p>There are several reasons why I don't believe in railway
station kisses. Kisses given in public are at best
but skimpy little things, suggesting the swift peck of a
robin at a peach, whereas it is truer of kissing than of
many other forms of industry that what is worth doing
at all is worth doing well. Yet I knew that one of these
enchantresses expected to be kissed, and that the other
very definitely didn't. Therefore I kissed them both.</p>

<p>Then I bolted toward the gate.</p>

<p>"Tickets!" demanded the gateman, stopping me.</p>

<p>At last I found them in the inside pocket of my overcoat.
I don't know how they got there. I never carry
tickets in that pocket.</p>

<p>As the train began to move I looked at my watch and,
discovering it to be three minutes fast, set it right.
That is the sort of train the Congressional Limited is.
A moment later we were roaring through the blackness
of the Hudson River tunnel.</p>

<p>There is something fine in the abruptness of the escape
from New York City by the Pennsylvania Railroad.
From the time you enter the station you are as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
good as gone. There is no progress between the city's
tenements, with untidy bedding airing in some windows
and fat old slatterns leaning out from others to survey
the sordidness and squalor of the streets below. A swift
plunge into darkness, some thundering moments, and
your train glides out upon the wide wastes of the New
Jersey meadows. The city is gone. You are even in
another State. Far, far behind, bathed in glimmering
haze which gives them the appearance of palaces in a
mirage, you may see the tops of New York's towering
sky-scrapers, dwarfed yet beautified by distance. Outside
the wide car window the advertising sign-boards
pass to the rear in steady parade, shrieking in strong
color of whiskies, tobaccos, pills, chewing gums, cough
drops, flours, hams, hotels, soaps, socks, and shows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

A BALTIMORE EVENING</h2>

</div></div>


<p>Before I went to Baltimore I had but two
definite impressions connected with the place:
the first was of a tunnel, filled with coal gas,
through which trains pass beneath the city; the second
was that when a southbound train left Baltimore the
time had come to think of cleaning up, preparatory to
reaching Washington.</p>

<p>Arriving at Baltimore after dark, one gathers an impression
of an adequate though not impressive Union
Station from which one emerges to a district of good
asphalted streets, the main ones wide and well lighted.
The Baltimore street lamps are large and very brilliant
single globes, mounted upon the tops of substantial
metal columns. I do not remember having seen lamps
of the same pattern in any other city. It is a good pattern,
but there is one thing about it which is not good
at all, and that is the way the street names are lettered
upon the sides of the globes. Though the lettering is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
not large, it is large enough to be read easily in the daytime
against the globe's white surface, but to try to
read it at night is like trying to read some little legend
printed upon a blinding noon-day sun. I noticed this
particularly because I spent my first evening in wandering
alone about the streets of Baltimore, and wished
to keep track of my route in order that I might the more
readily find my way back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Can most travelers, I wonder, enjoy as I do a solitary
walk, by night, through the mysterious streets of
a strange city? Do they feel the same detached yet
keen interest in unfamiliar highways, homes, and human
beings, the same sense of being a wanderer from
another world, a "messenger from Mars," a Harun-al-Rashid,
or, if not one of these, an imaginative adventurer
like Tartarin? Do they thrill at the sight of an
ill-lighted street leading into a no-man's-land of menacing
dark shadows; at the promise of a glowing window
puncturing the blackness here or there; at the invitation
of some open doorway behind which unilluminated
blackness hangs, threatening and tempting? Do they
rejoice in streets the names of which they have not
heard before? Do they&mdash;as I do&mdash;delight in irregularity:
in the curious forms of roofs and spires against
the sky; in streets which run up hill or down; or which,
instead of being straight, have jogs in them, or curves,
or interesting intersections, at which other streets dart
off from them obliquely, as though in a great hurry to
get somewhere? Do they love to emerge from a street<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which is narrow, dim, and deserted, upon one which is
wide, bright, and crowded; and do they also like to
leave a brilliant street and dive into the darkness of
some somber byway? Does a long row of lights lure
them, block by block, toward distances unknown? Are
they tempted by the unfamiliar signs on passing street
cars? Do they yearn to board those cars and be transported
by them into the mystic caverns of the night?
And when they see strangers who are evidently going
somewhere with some special purpose, do they wish to
follow; to find out where these beings are going, and
why? Do they wish to trail them, let the trail lead to
a prize fight, to a church sociable, to a fire, to a fashionable
ball, or to the ends of the world?</p>

<span class="caption">Can most travellers, I wonder, enjoy as I do a solitary walk, by night, through
the mysterious streets of a strange city?</span>
</div>

<p>For the traveler who does not know such sensations
and such impulses as these&mdash;who has not at times indulged
in the joy of yielding to an inclination of at least
mildly fantastic character&mdash;I am profoundly sorry.
The blind themselves are not so blind as those who, seeing
with the physical eye, lack the eye of imagination.</p>

<p>Residence streets like Chase and Biddle, in the blocks
near where they cross Charles Street, midway on its
course between the Union Station and Mount Vernon
Place, are at night, even more than by day, full of the
suggestion of comfortable and settled domesticity.
Their brick houses, standing wall to wall and close to
the sidewalk, speak of honorable age, and, in some
cases of a fine and ancient dignity. One fancies
that in many of these houses the best of old ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>hogany
may be found, or, if not that, then at least the
fairly old and quite creditable furniture of the period
of the sleigh-back bed, the haircloth-covered rosewood
sofa, and the tall, narrow mirror between the two front
windows of the drawing room.</p>

<p>Through the glass panels of street doors and beneath
half-drawn window shades the early-evening wayfarer
may perceive a feeble glow as of illuminating gas turned
low; but by ten o'clock these lights have begun to disappear,
indicating&mdash;or so, at all events, I chose to believe&mdash;that
certain old ladies wearing caps and black silk
gowns with old lace fichus held in place by ancient
cameos, have proceeded slowly, rustlingly, upstairs to
bed, accompanied by their cats.</p>

<p>At Cathedral Street, a block or two from Charles,
Biddle Street performs a jog, dashing off at a tangent
from its former course, while Chase Street not only jogs
and turns at the corresponding intersection, but does
so again, where, at the next corner, it meets at once with
Park Avenue and Berkeley Street. After this it runs
but a short way and dies, as though exhausted by its
own contortions.</p>

<p>Here, in a region of malformed city blocks&mdash;some of
them pentagonal, some irregularly quadrangular, some
wedge-shaped&mdash;Howard Street sets forth upon its way,
running first southwest as far as Richmond Street, then
turning south and becoming, by degrees, an important
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Somewhere near the beginning of Howard Street my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
attention was arrested by shadowy forms in a dark
window: furniture, andirons, chinaware, and weapons
of obsolete design: unmistakable signs of a shop in
which antiquities were for sale. After making mental
note of the location of this shop, I proceeded on my
way, keeping a sharp lookout for other like establishments.
Nor was I to be disappointed. These birds of
a feather bear out the truth of the proverb by flocking
together in Howard Street, as window displays, faintly
visible, informed me.</p>

<p>Since we have come naturally to the subject of antiques,
let us pause here, under a convenient lamp-post,
and discuss the matter further.</p>

<p>Baltimore&mdash;as I found out later&mdash;is probably the
headquarters for the South in this trade. It has at least
one dealer of Fifth Avenue rank, located on Charles
Street, and a number of humbler dealers in and near
Howard Street. Among the latter, two in particular
interested me. One of these&mdash;his name is John A.
Williar&mdash;I have learned to trust. Not only did I make
some purchases of him while I was in Baltimore, but
I have even gone so far, since leaving there, as to buy
from him by mail, accepting his assurance that some
article which I have not seen is, nevertheless, what I
want, and that it is "worth the price."</p>

<p>At the other antique shop which interested me I made
no purchases. The stock on hand was very large, and
if those who exhibited it to me made no mistakes in
differentiating between genuine antiques and copies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the assortment of ancient furniture on sale in that establishment,
when I was there, would rank among the
great collections of the world.</p>

<p>However, human judgment is not infallible, and
antique dealers sometimes make mistakes, offering, so
to speak, "new lamps for old." The eyesight of some
dealers may not be so good as that of others; or perhaps
one dealer does not know so well as another the
difference between, say, an old English Chippendale
chair and a New York reproduction; or again, perhaps,
some dealers may be innocently unaware that there exist,
in this land of ours, certain large establishments
wherein are manufactured most extraordinary modern
copies of the furniture of long ago. I have been in
one of these manufactories, and have there seen chairs
of Chippendale and Sheraton design which, though
fresh from the workman's hands, looked older than
the originals from which they had been plagiarized;
also I recall a Jacobean refectory table, the legs of which
appeared to have been eaten half away by time, but
which had, in reality, been "antiqued" with a stiff
wire brush. I mention this because, in my opinion, antique
dealers have a right to know that such factories
exist.</p>

<p>What curious differences there are between the customs
of one trade and those of another. Compare, for
instance, the dealer in old furniture with the dealer in
old automobiles. The latter, far from pronouncing a
machine of which he wishes to dispose "a genuine an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>tique,"
will assure you&mdash;and not always with a strict
regard for truth&mdash;that it is "practically as good as
new." Or compare the seller of antiques with the horse
dealer. Can you imagine the latter's taking you up to
some venerable quadruped&mdash;let alone a three-year-old&mdash;and
discoursing upon its merits in some such manner as
the following:</p>

<p>"This is the oldest and most historic horse that has
ever come into my possession. Just look at it, sir!
The farmer of whom I bought it assured me that it
was brought over by his ancestors in the <i>Mayflower</i>.
The place where I found it was used as Washington's
headquarters during the Revolutionary War, and it is
known that Washington himself frequently sat on this
very horse. It was a favorite of his. For he was a
large man and he liked a big, comfortable, deep-seated
horse, well braced underneath, and having strong arms,
so that he could tilt it back comfortably against the wall,
with its front legs off the floor, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But no! That won't do. It appears I have gotten
mixed. However, you know what I meant to indicate.
I merely meant to show that a horse dealer wouldn't
talk about a horse as an antique dealer would talk about
a chair. Even if the horse was once actually ridden by
the Father of his Country, the dealer won't stress the
point. You can't get him to admit that a horse has
reached years of discretion, let alone that it is one hundred
and forty-five years old, or so. It is this difference
between the horse dealer and the dealer in antiques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which keeps us in the dark to-day as to exactly which
horses Washington rode and which he didn't ride; although
we know every chair he ever sat in, and every
bed he ever slept in, and every house he ever stopped
in, and how he is said to have caught his death of cold.</p>

<p>Having thus wandered afield, let me now resume my
nocturnal walk.</p>

<p>Proceeding down Howard Street to Franklin, I
judged by the signs I saw about me&mdash;the conglomerate
assortment of theaters, hotels, rathskellers, bars, and
brilliantly lighted drug stores&mdash;that here was the center
of the city's nighttime life.</p>

<p>Not far from this corner is the Academy, a very
spacious and somewhat ancient theater, and although
the hour was late, into the Academy I went with a ticket
for standing room.</p>

<p>Arriving during an intermission, I had a good view
of the auditorium. It is reminiscent, in its interior
"decoration," of the recently torn-down Wallack's Theater
in New York. The balcony is supported, after the
old fashion, by posts, and there are boxes the tops of
which are draped with tasseled curtains. It is the kind
of theater which suggests traditions, dust, and the possibility
of fire and panic.</p>

<p>After looking about me for a time, I drew from my
pocket a pamphlet which I had picked up in the hotel,
and began to gather information about the "Monumental
City," as Baltimore sometimes calls itself&mdash;thereby
misusing the word, since "monumental" means, in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
sense, "enduring," and in another "pertaining to or
serving as a monument": neither of which ideas it is
intended, in this instance, to convey. What Baltimore
intends to indicate is, not that it pertains to monuments,
but that monuments pertain to it: that it is a city in
which many monuments have been erected&mdash;as is indeed
the pleasing fact. My pamphlet informed me that
the first monument to Columbus and the first to George
Washington were here put up, and that among the city's
other monuments was one to Francis Scott Key. I had
quite forgotten that it was at Baltimore that Key wrote
the words of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and, as
others may have done the same, it may be well here to
recall the details.</p>

<p>In 1814, after the British had burned a number of
Government buildings in Washington, including "the
President's palace" (as one of their officers expressed
it), they moved on Baltimore, making an attack by land
at North Point and a naval attack at Fort McHenry on
Whetstone Point in the estuary of the Patapsco River&mdash;here
practically an arm of Chesapeake Bay. Both attacks
were repulsed. Having gone on the United States
cartel ship <i>Minden</i> (used by the government in negotiating
exchanges of prisoners) to intercede for his
friend, Dr. William Beanes, of Upper Marlborough,
Maryland, who was held captive on a British vessel, Key
witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry from the
deck of the <i>Minden</i>, and when he perceived "by the
dawn's early light" that the flag still flew over the fort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
he was moved to write his famous poem. Later it was
printed and set to music; it was first sung in a restaurant
near the old Holliday Street Theater, but neither the
restaurant nor the theater exists to-day. It is sometimes
stated that Key was himself a prisoner, during
the bombardment, on a British warship. That is a mistake.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence, only a few minutes after
my pamphlet had reminded me of the origin of "The
Star-Spangled Banner" here in Baltimore, I heard the
air played under circumstances very different from any
which could have been anticipated by the author of the
poem, or the composer who set it to music.</p>

<p>The entertainment at the Academy that night was
supplied by an elaborate "show" of the burlesque variety
known as "The Follies," and it so happened that in the
course of this hodgepodge of color, comedy, scenery,
song, and female anatomy, there was presented a "number"
in which actors, garbed and frescoed with intent
to resemble rulers of various lands, marched successively
to the front of the stage, preceded in each instance by a
small but carefully selected guard wearing the full-dress-uniform
of Broadway Amazons. This uniform consists
principally of tights and high-heeled slippers, the
different nations being indicated, usually, by means of
color combinations and various types of soldiers' hats.
No arms are presented save those provided by nature.</p>

<p>The King of Italy, the Emperor of Austria, the Czar,
the Mikado, the British Monarch, the President of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
France, the King of the Belgians, the Kaiser (for the
United States had not then entered the war), and, I
think, some others, put in an appearance, each accompanied
by his Paphian escort, his standard, and the appropriate
national air. Apprehending that this symbolic
travesty must, almost inevitably, end in a grand
orgy of Yankee-Doodleism, I was impelled to flee the
place before the thing should happen. Yet a horrid
fascination held me there to watch the working up of
"patriotic" sentiment by the old, cheap, stage tricks.</p>

<p>Presently, of course, the supreme moment came.
When all the potentates had taken their positions, right
and left, with their silk-limbed soldiery in double ranks
behind them, there came into view upstage a squad of
little white-clad female naval officers, each, according to
my recollection, carrying the Stars and Stripes. As
these marched forward and deployed as skirmishers before
the footlights, the orchestra struck up "The Star-Spangled
Banner," fortissimo, and with a liberal sounding
of the brasses. Upon this appeared at the back a
counterfeit President of the United States, guarded on
either side by a female militia&mdash;or were they perhaps
secret-service agents?&mdash;in striking uniforms consisting
of pink fleshings partially draped with thin black lace.</p>

<p>As this incongruous parade proceeded to the footlights,
American flags came into evidence, and, though
I forget whether or not Columbia appeared, I recollect
that a beautiful young woman, habited in what appeared
to be a light pink union suit of unexceptionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
cut and material, appeared above the head of the pseudo-chief
executive, suspended at the end of a wire. Never
having heard that it was White House etiquette to hang
young ladies on wires above the presidential head, I
consulted my program and thereby learned that this
young lady represented that species of poultry so popular
always with the late Secretary of State, Mr. Bryan,
and so popular also at one time with the President himself:
namely, the Dove of Peace.</p>

<p>The applause was thunderous. At the sound of "The
Star-Spangled Banner" a few members of the audience
arose to their feet; others soon followed&mdash;some of them
apparently with reluctance&mdash;until at last the entire house
had risen. Meanwhile the members of the company
lined up before the footlights: the mock president smirking
at the center, the half-clad girls posing, the pink
young lady dangling above, the band blaring, the Stars
and Stripes awave. It was a scene, in all, about as conducive
to genuine or creditable national pride as would
be the scene of a debauch in some fabulous harem.</p>

<p>The difference between stupidity and satire lies, not
infrequently, in the intent with which a thing is done.
Presented without essential change upon the stage of a
music hall in some foreign land, the scene just described
would, at that time, when we were playing a timid part
amongst the nations, have been accepted, not as a glorification
of the United States, but as having a precisely
opposite significance. It would have been taken for
burlesque; burlesque upon our country, our President,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
our national spirit, our peace policy, our army, and perhaps
also upon our women&mdash;and insulting burlesque at
that.</p>

<p>Some years since, it was found necessary to pass a law
prohibiting the use of the flag for advertising purposes.
This law should be amended to protect it also from
the even more sordid and vulgarizing associations to
which it is not infrequently submitted on the American
musical-comedy stage.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the morning, before I was awake, my companion
arrived at the hotel, and, going to his room, opened the
door connecting it with mine. Coming out of my slumber
with that curious and not altogether pleasant sense
of being stared at, I found his eyes fixed upon me, and
noticed immediately about him the air of virtuous superiority
which is assumed by all who have risen early,
whether they have done so by choice or have been shaken
awake.</p>

<span class="caption">Coming out of my slumber with the curious and unpleasant sense of being stared at, I found his eyes fixed upon me</span>
</div>

<p>"Hello," I said. "Had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No. I thought we could breakfast together if you
felt like getting up."</p>

<p>Though the phraseology of this remark was unexceptionable,
I knew what it meant. What it really
meant was: "Shame on you, lying there so lazy after
sunup! Look at <i>me</i>, all dressed and ready to begin!"</p>

<p>I arose at once.</p>

<p>For all that I don't like to get up early, it recalled old
times, and was very pleasant, to be away with him again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
upon our travels; to be in a strange city and a strange
hotel, preparing to set forth on explorations. For he
is the best, the most charming, the most observant of
companions, and also one of the most patient.</p>

<p>That is one of his greatest qualities&mdash;his patience.
Throughout our other trip he always kept on being patient
with me, no matter what I did. Many a time
instead of pushing me down an elevator shaft, drowning
me in my bath, or coming in at night and smothering
me with a pillow, he has merely sighed, dropped
into a chair, and sat there shaking his head and staring
at me with a melancholy, ruminative, hopeless expression&mdash;such
an expression as may come into the face of
a dumb man when he looks at a waiter who has spilled
an oyster cocktail on him.</p>

<p>All this is good for me. It has a chastening effect.</p>

<p>Therefore in a spirit happy yet not exuberant, eager
yet controlled, hopeful yet a little bit afraid, I dressed
myself hurriedly, breakfasted with him (eating ham
and eggs because he approves of ham and eggs), and
after breakfast set out in his society to obtain what&mdash;despite
my walk of the night before&mdash;I felt was not
alone my first real view of Baltimore, but my first
glimpse over the threshold of the South: into the land
of aristocracy and hospitality, of mules and mammies,
of plantations, porticos, and proud, flirtatious belles, of
colonels, cotton, chivalry, and colored cooking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Because Baltimore was built, like Rome, on
seven hills, and because trains run under it instead
of through, the passing traveler sees but
little of the city, his view from the train window being
restricted first to a suburban district, then to a black
tunnel, then to a glimpse upward from the railway
cut, in which the station stands. These facts, I think,
combine to leave upon his mind an impression which,
if not actually unfavorable, is at least negative; for certainly
he has obtained no just idea of the metropolis of
Maryland.</p>

<p>Let it be declared at the outset, then, that Baltimore
is not in any sense to be regarded as a suburb
of Washington. Indeed, considering the two merely as
cities situated side by side, and eliminating the highly
specialized features of Washington, Baltimore becomes,
according to the standards by which American cities
are usually compared, the more important city of the
two, being greater both in population and in commerce.
In this aspect Baltimore may, perhaps, be pictured as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
commercial half of Washington. And while Washington,
as capital of the United States, has certain physical
and cosmopolitan advantages, not only over Baltimore,
but over every other city on this continent, it must
not be forgotten that, upon the other hand, every other
city has one vast advantage over Washington, namely,
a comparative freedom from politicians. To be sure,
Congress did once move over to Baltimore and sit there
for several weeks, but that was in 1776, when the British
approached the Delaware in the days before the pork
barrel was invented.</p>

<p>As a city Baltimore has marked characteristics.
Though south of Mason and Dixon's Line, and though
sometimes referred to as the "metropolis of the South"
(as is New Orleans also), it is in character neither a city
entirely northern nor entirely southern, but one which
partakes of the qualities of both; where, in the words
of Sidney Lanier, "the climates meet," and where northern
and southern thought and custom meet, as well.
This has long been the case. Thus, although slaves
were held in Baltimore before the Civil War, a strong
abolitionist society was formed there during Washington's
first Administration, and the sentiment of the city
was thereafter divided on the slavery question. Thus
also, while the two candidates of the divided Democratic
party who ran against Lincoln for the presidency in
1860 were nominated at Baltimore, Lincoln himself was
nominated there by the Union-Republican party in 1864.</p>

<p>Speaking of the blending of North and South in Balti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>more,
you will, of course, remember that the Sixth
Massachusetts Regiment was attacked by a mob as it
passed through the city on the way to the Civil War.
The regiment arrived in Baltimore at the old President
Street Station, which was then the main station of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, and which, now used as a freight
station, looks like an old war-time woodcut out of
<i>Harper's Weekly</i>. It was the custom in those days
to hitch horses to passenger coaches which were going
through and draw them across town to the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio Station; but when it was attempted thus to transport
the northern troops a mob gathered and blocked
the Pratt Street bridge over Jones's Falls, forcing the
soldiers to leave the cars and march through Pratt
Street, along the water front, where they were attacked.
It is, however, a noteworthy fact that Mayor Brown
of Baltimore bravely preceded the troops and attempted
to stop the rioting. A few days later the city was occupied
by northern troops, and the warship <i>Harriet Lane</i>
anchored at a point off Calvert Street, whence her guns
commanded the business part of town. After this
there was no more serious trouble. Moreover, it will
be remembered that though Maryland was represented
by regiments in both armies, the State, torn as it
was by conflicting feeling, nevertheless held to the
Union.</p>

<p>A pretty sequel to the historic attack on the Sixth
Massachusetts occurred when the same regiment passed
through Baltimore in 1898, on its way to the Spanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
War. On this occasion it was "attacked" again in the
streets of the city, but the missiles thrown, instead of
paving-stones and bricks, were flowers.</p>

<p>Continuing the category of contrasts, one may observe
that while the general appearance of Baltimore
suggests a northern city rather than a southern one&mdash;Philadelphia,
for instance, rather than Richmond&mdash;Baltimore
society is strongly flavored with the tradition and
the soft pronunciation of the South; particularly of
Virginia and the "Eastern Shore."</p>

<p>So, too, the city's position on the border line is reflected
in its handling of the negro. Of American cities,
Washington has the largest negro population, 94,446,
New York and New Orleans follow with almost as
many, and Baltimore comes fourth with 84,749, according
to the last census. New York has one negro to
every fifty-one whites, Philadelphia one to every seventeen
whites, Baltimore one to every six, Washington a
negro to every two and a half whites, and Richmond not
quite two whites to every negro. But, although Baltimore
follows southern practice in maintaining separate
schools for negro children, and in segregating negro
residences to certain blocks, she follows northern practice
in casting a considerable negro vote at elections, and
also in not providing separate seats for negroes in her
street cars.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how cities sometimes seem
to have their own especial colors? Paris is white and
green&mdash;even more so, I think, than Washington. Chi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>cago
is gray; so is London usually, though I have seen it
buff at the beginning of a heavy fog. New York used
to be a brown sandstone city, but is now turning to one
of cream-colored brick and tile; Naples is brilliant with
pink and blue and green and white and yellow; while as
for Baltimore, her old houses and her new are, as Baedeker
puts it, of "cheerful red brick"&mdash;not always, of
course, but often enough to establish the color of red
brick as the city's predominating hue. And with the
red-brick houses&mdash;particularly the older ones&mdash;go clean
white marble steps, on the bottom one of which, at the
side, may usually be found an old-fashioned iron
"scraper," doubtless left over from the time (not very
long ago) when the city pavements had not reached their
present excellence.</p>

<p>The color of red brick is not confined to the center of
the city, but spreads to the suburbs, fashionable and
unfashionable. At one margin of the town I was shown
solid blocks of pleasant red-brick houses which, I was
told, were occupied by workmen and their families, and
were to be had at a rental of from ten to twenty dollars
a month. For though Baltimore has a lower East
Side which, like the lower East Side of New York, encompasses
the Ghetto and Italian quarter, she has not
tenements in the New York sense; one sees no tall, cheap
flat houses draped with fire escapes and built to make
herding places for the poor. Many of the houses in
this section are instead the former homes of fashionables
who have moved to other quarters of the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&mdash;handsome
old homesteads with here and there a lovely,
though battered, doorway sadly reminiscent of an earlier
elegance. So, also, red brick permeates the prosperous
suburbs, such as Roland Park and Guilford, where, in a
sweetly rolling country which lends itself to the arrangement
of graceful winding roads and softly contoured
plantings, stand quantities of pleasing homes,
lately built, many of them colonial houses of red brick.
Indeed, it struck us that the only parts of Baltimore
in which red brick was not the dominant note were the
downtown business section and Mount Vernon Place.</p>

<p>Mount Vernon Place is the center of Baltimore.
Everything begins there, including Baedeker, who, in
his little red book, gives it the asterisk of his approval,
says that it "suggests Paris in its tasteful monuments
and surrounding buildings," and recommends the view
from the top of the Washington Monument.</p>

<span class="caption">Mount Vernon Place is the centre of Baltimore. Everything begins there, including Baedeker</span>
</div>

<p>This monument, standing upon an eminence at the
point where Charles and Monument Streets would cross
each other were not their courses interrupted by the
pleasing parked space of Mount Vernon Place, is a
gray stone column, surmounted by a figure of Washington&mdash;or,
rather, by the point of a lightning rod under
which the figure stands. Other monuments are known
as this monument or that, but when "the monument"
is spoken of, the Washington Monument is inevitably
meant. This is quite natural, for it is not only the most
simple and picturesque old monument in Baltimore, but
also the largest, the oldest, and the most conspicuous:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
its proud head, rising high in air, having for nearly
a century dominated the city. One catches glimpses of
it down this street or that, or sees it from afar over the
housetops; and sometimes, when the column is concealed
from view by intervening buildings, and only the surmounting
statue shows above them, one is struck by a
sudden apparition of the Father of his Country strolling
fantastically upon some distant roof.</p>

<p>Though it may be true that Mount Vernon Place,
with its symmetrical parked center and its admirable
bronzes (several of them by Bary&eacute;), suggests Paris,
and though it is certainly true that it is more like a
Parisian square than a London square, nevertheless it is
in reality an American square&mdash;perhaps the finest of its
kind in the United States. If it were Parisian, it would
have more trees and the surrounding buildings would be
uniform in color and in cornice height. It is perhaps
as much like Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia as any
other, and that resemblance is of the slightest, for Mount
Vernon Place has a quality altogether its own. It
has no skyscrapers or semi-skyscrapers to throw it out
of balance; and though the structures which surround
it are of white stone, brown stone, and red brick, and of
anything but homogeneous architecture, nevertheless a
comparative uniformity of height, a universal solidity
of construction, and a general grace about them, combine
to give the Place an air of equilibrium and dignity
and elegance.</p>

<p>Including the Washington Monument, Baltimore has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
three lofty landmarks, likely to be particularly noticed
by the roving visitor. Of the remaining two, one is the
old brick shot-tower in the lower part of town, which
legend tells us was put up without the use of scaffolding
nearly a hundred years ago; while the other, a more
modern, if less modest structure, proudly surmounts a
large commercial building and is itself capped by the
gigantic effigy of a bottle. This bottle is very conspicuous
because of its emplacement, because it revolves,
and because it is illuminated at night. You can never
get away from it.</p>

<p>One evening I asked a man what the bottle meant up
there.</p>

<p>"It's a memorial to Emerson," he told me.</p>

<p>"Are they so fond of Emerson down here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as they are so all-fired fond of him,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"But they <i>must</i> be fond of him to put up such a big
memorial. Why, even in Boston, where he was born,
they have no such memorial as that."</p>

<p>"He put it up himself," said the man.</p>

<p>That struck me as strange. It seemed somehow out
of character with the great philosopher. Also, I could
not see why, if he did wish to raise a memorial to himself,
he had elected to fashion it in the form of a bottle
and put it on top of an office building.</p>

<p>"I suppose there is some sort of symbolism about it?"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Now you got it," approved the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>I gazed at the tower for a while in thought. Then
I said:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that Emerson meant something like
this: that human life or, indeed, the soul, may be likened
to the contents of a bottle; that day by day we use up
some portion of the contents&mdash;call it, if you like, the
nectar of existence&mdash;until the fluid of life runs low, and
at last is gone entirely, leaving only the husk, as it were&mdash;or,
to make the metaphor more perfect, the shell, or
empty bottle: the container of what Emerson himself
called, if I recollect correctly, 'the soul that maketh all'&mdash;do
you suppose he meant to teach us some such thing
as that?"</p>

<p>The man looked a little confused by this deep and
beautiful thought.</p>

<p>"He <i>might</i> of meant that," he said, somewhat dubiously.
"But they tell me Captain Emerson's a practical
man, and I reckon what he <i>mainly</i> meant was that he
made his money out of this-here Bromo Seltzer, and he
was darn glad of it, so he thought he'd put him up a big
Bromo Seltzer bottle as a kind of cross between a monument
and an ad."</p>

<p>If the bottle tower represents certain modern concepts
of what is suitable in architecture, it is nevertheless
pleasant to record the fact that many honorable
old buildings&mdash;most of them residences&mdash;survive in
Baltimore, and that, because of their survival, the city
looks older than New York and fully as old as either
Philadelphia or Boston. But in this, appearances are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
misleading, for New York and Boston were a century
old, and Philadelphia half a century, when Baltimore
was first laid out as a town. Efforts to start a settlement
near the city's present site were, it is true, being
made before William Penn and his Quakers established
Philadelphia, but a letter written in 1687 by Charles Calvert,
third Baron Baltimore, explains that: "The people
there [are] not affecting to build nere each other but
soe as to have their houses nere the watters for conveniencye
of trade and their lands on each side of and
behynde their houses, by which it happens that in most
places there are not fifty houses in the space of thirty
myles."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The difficulty experienced by the Barons Baltimore,
Lords Proprietary of Maryland, in building up communities
in their demesne was not a local problem, but one
which confronted those interested in the development
of the entire portion of this continent now occupied by
the Southern States. Generally speaking, towns came
into being more slowly in the South than in the North,
and it seems probable that one of the principal reasons
for this may be found in the fact that settlers throughout
the South lived generally at peace with the Indians,
whereas the northern settlers were obliged to congregate
in towns for mutual protection. Thus, in colonial
days, while the many cities of New York and New England
were coming into being, the South was developing
its vast and isolated plantations. Farms on the St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Lawrence River and on the Detroit River, where the
French were settling, were very narrow and very deep,
the idea being to range the houses close together on the
river front; but on such rivers as the Potomac, the Rappahannock
and the James, no element of early fear is to
be traced in the form of the broad baronial plantations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Baltimore began at last to grow,
she became a prodigy, not only among American cities,
but among the cities of the world. Her first town directory
was published in 1796, and she began the next
year as an incorporated city, with a mayor, a population
of about twenty thousand, and a curiously assorted early
history containing such odd items as that the first umbrella
carried in the United States was brought from
India and unfurled in Baltimore in 1772; that the town
had for some time possessed such other useful articles
as a fire engine, a brick theater, a newspaper, and
policemen; that the streets were lighted with oil lamps;
that such proud signs of metropolitanism as riot and epidemic
were not unknown; that before the Revolution
bachelors were taxed for the benefit of his Britannic
Majesty; and that at fair time the "lid was off," and the
citizen or visitor who wished to get himself arrested
must needs be diligent indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the incorporation of the city, Baltimore
grew much as Chicago was destined to
grow more than a century later; within less than
thirty years, when Chicago was a tiny village, Baltimore
had become the third city in the United States: a
city of wealthy merchants engaged in an extensive foreign
trade; for in those days there was an American
merchant marine, and the swift, rakish Baltimore clippers
were known the seven seas over.</p>

<p>The story of modern Baltimore is entirely unrelated
to the city's early history. It consists in a simple but
inspiring record of regeneration springing from disaster.
It is the story of Chicago, of San Francisco, of
Galveston, of Dayton, and of many a smaller town: a
cataclysm, a few days of despair, a return of courage,
and another beginning.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself being tucked into bed one night by
your valet or your maid, as the case may be, calm in the
feeling that all was secure: that your business was returning
a handsome income, that your stocks and bonds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
were safe in the strong box, that the prosperity of your
descendants was assured. Then imagine ruin coming
like lightning in the night. In the morning you are
poor. Your business, your investments, your very
hopes, are gone. Everything is wiped out. The labor
of a lifetime must be begun again.</p>

<p>Such an experience was that of Baltimore in the fire
of 1904.</p>

<p>On the sickening morning following the conflagration
two Baltimore men, friends of mine, walked down
Charles Street to a point as near the ruined region as it
was possible to go.</p>

<p>"Well," said one, surveying the smoking crater, "what
do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Baltimore is gone," was the response. "We are off
the map."</p>

<p>How many citizens of Chicago, of San Francisco, of
Galveston, of Dayton have known the anguish of that
first aftermath of hopelessness! How many citizens of
Baltimore knew it that day! And yet how bravely
and with what magic swiftness have these cities risen
from their ruins! Was not Rome burned? Was
not London? And is it not, then, time for men to learn
from the history of other men and other cities that disaster
does not spell the end, but is oftentimes another
name for opportunity?</p>

<p>Always, after disaster to a city, come improvements,
but because disaster not only cleans the slate but simultaneously
stuns the mind, a portion of the opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
is invariably lost. The task of rebuilding, of widening
a few streets, looks large enough to him who stands
amidst destruction&mdash;and there, consequently, improvement
usually stops. That is why the downtown boulevard
system of Chicago has yet to be completed, in spite
of the fact that it might with little difficulty have been
completed after the Chicago fire (although it is only
just to add that city planning was almost an unknown
art in America at that time); and that also is why the
hills of San Francisco are not terraced, as it was suggested
they should be after the fire, but remain to-day
inaccessible to frontal attack by even the maddest mountain
goat of a taxi driver.</p>

<p>These matters are not mentioned in the way of criticism:
I have only admiration for the devastated cities
and for those who built them up again. I call attention
to lost opportunities with something like reluctance,
and only in the wish to emphasize the fact that our
crippled or destroyed cities do invariably rise again, and
that if the next American city to sustain disaster shall
but have this simple lesson learned in advance, it may
thereby register a new high mark in municipal intelligence
and a new record among the rebuilt cities, by
making more sweet than any other city ever made them,
the uses of adversity.</p>

<p>The fire of 1904 found Baltimore a town of narrow
highways, old buildings, bad pavements, and open gutter
drains. The streets were laid in what is known as
"southern cobble," which is the next thing to no pave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ment
at all, being made of irregular stones, large and
small, laid in the dirt and tamped down. For bumps
and ruts there is no pavement in the world to be compared
with it. There were no city sewers. Outside a
few affluent neighborhoods, the citizens of which clubbed
together to build private sewers, the cesspool was in general
use, while domestic drainage emptied into the roadside
gutters. These were made passable, at crossings,
by stepping stones, about the bases of which passed interesting
armadas of potato peelings, floating, upon
wash days, in water having the fine Mediterranean hue
which comes from diluted blueing. Everybody seemed
to find the entire system adequate; for, it was argued,
the hilly contours of the city caused the drainage quickly
to be carried off, while as for typhoid and mosquitoes&mdash;well,
there had always been typhoid and mosquitoes, just
as there had always been these open gutters. It was all
quite good enough.</p>

<p>Then the fire.</p>

<p>And then the upbuilding of the city&mdash;not only of the
acres and acres comprising the burned section, in which
streets were widened and skyscrapers arose where fire-traps
had been&mdash;but outside the fire zone, where sewers
were put down and pavements laid. Nor was the change
merely physical. With the old buildings, the old spirit
of <i>laissez faire</i> went up in smoke, and in the embers a
municipal conscience was born. Almost as though by
the light of the flames which engulfed it, the city began
to see itself as it had never seen itself before: to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
take account of stock, to plan broadly for the future.</p>

<p>Nor has the new-born spirit died. Only last year an
extensive red-light district was closed effectively and
once for all. Baltimore is to-day free from flagrant
commercialized vice. And if not quite all the old cobble
pavements and open-gutter drains have been eliminated,
there are but few of them left&mdash;left almost as though for
purposes of contrast&mdash;and the Baltimorean who takes
you to the Ghetto and shows you these ancient remnants
may immediately thereafter escort you to the Fallsway,
where the other side of the picture is presented.</p>

<p>The Fallsway is a brand-new boulevard of pleasing
aspect, the peculiar feature of which is that it is nothing
more or less than a cover over the top of Jones's Falls,
which figured in the early history of Baltimore as a
water course, but which later came to figure as a great,
open, trunk sewer.</p>

<p>Every one in Baltimore is proud of the Fallsway, but
particularly so are the city engineers who carried the
work through. While in Baltimore I had the pleasure
of meeting one of these gentlemen, and I can assure you
that no young head of a family was ever more delighted
with his new cottage in a suburb, his wife, his children,
his garden, and his collie puppy, than was this engineer
with his boulevard sewer. Like a lover, he carried pictures
of it in his pocket, and like a lover he would assure
you that it was "not like other sewers." Nor could
he speak of it without beginning to wish to take you out
to see it&mdash;not merely for a motor ride along the top of it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
either. No, his hospitality did not stop there. When
<i>he</i> invited you to a sewer he invited you <i>in</i>. And if you
went in with him, no one could make you come out until
you wanted to.</p>

<p>As he told my companion and me of the three great
tubes, the walks beside them, the conduits for gas and
electricity, and all the other wonders of the place, I began
to wish that we might go with him, for, though we
have been to a good many places together, this was
something new: it was the first time we had ever been
invited to drop into a sewer and make ourselves as much
at home as though we lived there.</p>

<p>My companion, however, seemed unsympathetic to the
project.</p>

<p>"Sewers, you know," he said, when I taxed him with
indifference, "have come to have a very definite place in
both the literary and the graphic arts. How do you propose
to treat it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When you write about it: Are you going to write
about it as a realist, a mystic, or a romanticist?"</p>

<p>I said I didn't know.</p>

<p>"Well, a man who is going to write of a sewer <i>ought</i>
to know," he told me severely. "You're not up to
sewers yet. They're too big for you. If you take my
advice you'll keep out of the sewers for the present and
stick to the gutters."</p>

<p>So I did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

TERRAPIN AND THINGS</h2>


<p>Baltimore society has a Maryland and Virginia
base, but is seasoned with families of
Acadian descent, and with others descended from
the Pennsylvania Dutch&mdash;those "Dutch" who, by the
way, are not Dutch at all, being of Saxon and Bavarian
extraction. Many Virginians settled in Baltimore after
the war, and it may be in part owing to this fact, that
fox-hunting with horse and hound, as practised for
three centuries past in England, and for nearly two
centuries by Virginia's country gentlemen, is carried on
extensively in the neighborhood of Baltimore, by the
Green Spring Valley Hunt Club, the Elkridge Fox-Hunting
Club and some others&mdash;which brings me to the
subject of clubs in general.</p>

<p>The Baltimore Country Club, at Roland Park, just
beyond the city limits, has a large, well-set clubhouse, an
active membership, and charming rolling golf links, one
peculiarity of the course being that a part of the city's
water-supply system has been utilized for hazards.</p>

<p>The two characteristic clubs of the city itself, the
Maryland Club and the Baltimore Club, are known the
country over. The former occupies a position in Baltimore
comparable with that of the Union Club in New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
York, the Chicago Club in Chicago, or the Pacific Union
in San Francisco, and has to its credit at least one
famous dish: Terrapin, Maryland Club Style.</p>

<p>The Baltimore Club is used by a younger group of
men and has a particularly pleasant home in a large
mansion, formerly the residence of the Abell family,
long known in connection with that noteworthy old sheet,
the Baltimore "Sun," which, it may be remarked in passing,
is curiously referred to by many Baltimoreans, not
as the "Sun," but as the "Sun-paper."</p>

<p>This odd item reminds me of another: In the Balti-telephone
book I chanced to notice under the letter "F"
the entry:</p>

<p>Fisher, Frank, of J.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry I learned that the significance of this
was that, there being more than one gentleman of the
name of Frank Fisher in the city, this Mr. Frank Fisher
added "of J" to his name (meaning "son of John") for
purposes of differentiation. I was informed further
that this custom is not uncommon in Baltimore, in cases
where a name is duplicated, and I was shown another
example: that of Mr. John Fyfe Symington
of S.</p>

<p>A typically southern institution of long standing, and
highly characteristic of the social life of Baltimore, is
the Bachelors' Cotillion, one of the oldest dancing clubs
in the country. During the season this organization
gives a series of some half-dozen balls which are the
events of the fashionable year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The organization and general character of the Bachelors'
Cotillion is not unlike that of the celebrated St.
Cecilia Society of Charleston. The cost of membership
is so slight that almost any eligible young man
can easily afford it. There is, however, a long waiting-list.
The club is controlled by a board of governors,
the members of which hold office for life, and who, instead
of being elected by the organization are selected
<i>in camera</i> by the board itself, when vacancies occur.</p>

<p>The balls given by this society are known as the Monday
Germans, and at these balls, which are held in the
Lyric Theater, the city's d&eacute;butantes are presented to
society. As in all southern cities, much is made of
d&eacute;butantes in Baltimore. On the occasion of their first
Monday German all their friends send them flowers,
and they appear flower-laden at the ball, followed by
their relatives who are freighted down with their darlings'
superfluous bouquets. The modern steps are
danced at these balls, but there are usually a few cotillion
figures, albeit without "favors." And perhaps the best
part of it all is that the first ball of the season, and the
Christmas ball, end at one o'clock, and that all the others
end at midnight. That seems to me a humane arrangement,
although the opinion may only signify that I am
growing old.</p>

<p>Another very characteristic phase of Baltimore life,
and of southern life&mdash;at least in many cities&mdash;is that,
instead of dealing with the baker, and the grocer, and
the fish-market man around the corner, all Baltimore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
women go to the great market-sheds and do their own
selecting under what amounts to one great roof.</p>

<p>The Lexington Market, to which my companion and
I had the good fortune to be taken by a Baltimore lady,
is comparable, in its picturesqueness with <i>Les Halles</i> of
Paris, or the fascinating market in Seattle, where the
Japanese pile up their fresh vegetables with such charming
show of taste. The great sheds cover three long
blocks, and in the countless stall-like shops which they
contain may be found everything for the table, including
flowers to trim it and after-dinner sweets. I doubt
that any northern housewife knows such a market or
such a profusion of comestibles. In one stall may be
purchased meat, in the next vegetables, in the next fish,
in the next bread and cake, in the next butter and buttermilk,
in the next fruit, or game, or flowers, or&mdash;at Christmas
time&mdash;tree trimmings. These stalls, with their contents,
are duplicated over and over again; and if your
fair guide be shopping for a dinner party, at which two
men from out of town are to be initiated into the delights
of the Baltimore cuisine, she may order up the
costly and aristocratic <i>Malacoclemmys</i>, the diamond-back
terrapin, sacred in Baltimore as is the Sacred Cod
himself in Boston.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

<img src="images/p48.jpg" width="434" height="469" alt="If she is shopping for a dinner party, she may order the costly and aristocratic

<span class="caption">If she is shopping for a dinner party, she may order the costly and aristocratic
diamond-back terrapin, sacred in Baltimore as is the Sacred Cod in Boston</span>
</div>

<p>The admirable encyclopedia of Messrs. Funk &amp; Wagnall's
informs me that "the diamond-back salt-water terrapin ...
is caught in salt marshes along the coast
from New England to Texas, <i>the finest being those of
the Massachusetts and the northern coasts</i>." The italics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
are mine; and upon the italicized passage I expect the
mayor and town council of Baltimore, or even the
Government of the State of Maryland, to proceed against
Messrs. Funk &amp; Wagnalls, whose valuable volumes
should forthwith be placed upon the State's <i>index expurgatorius</i>.</p>

<p>Of a marketman I obtained the following lore concerning
the tortoise of the terrapin species:</p>

<p>In the Baltimore markets four kinds of terrapin are
sold&mdash;not counting muskrat, which is sometimes disguised
with sauce and sherry and served as a substitute.
The cheapest and toughest terrapin is known as the
"slider." Slightly superior to the "slider" is the "fat-back,"
measuring, usually, about nine or ten inches in
length, and costing, at retail, fifty cents to a dollar, according
to season and demand. Somewhat better than
the "fat-back," but of about the same size and cost, is
the "golden-stripe" terrapin; but all these are the merest
poor relations of the diamond-back. Some diamond-back
terrapin are supplied for the Baltimore market
from North Carolina, but these, my marketman assured
me, are inferior to those of Chesapeake Bay. (Everything
in, or from, North Carolina seems to be inferior,
according to the people of the other Southern States.)</p>

<p>Although there is a closed season for terrapin, the
value of the diamond-back causes him to be relentlessly
hunted during the open season, with the result that, like
the delectable lobster, he is passing. As the foolish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
lobster-fishermen of northern New England are killing
the goose&mdash;or, rather, the crustacean&mdash;that lays the
golden eggs, so are the terrapin hunters of the Chesapeake.
Two or three decades ago, lobster and terrapin
alike were eaten in the regions of their abundance as
cheap food. One Baltimore lady told me that her
father's slaves, on an Eastern Shore plantation, used to
eat terrapin. Yet behold the cost of the precious diamond-back
to-day! In his smaller sizes, according to
my marketman, he is worth about a dollar an inch,
while when grown to fair proportions he costs as much
as a railroad ticket from Baltimore to Chicago. And
for my part I would about as soon eat the ticket as the
terrapin.</p>

<p>Of a number of other odd items which help to give
Baltimore distinct flavor I find the following in my notebooks:</p>

<p>There are good street railways; also 'bus lines operated
by the United Railways Company. Under the
terms of its charter this company was originally obliged
to turn over to the city thirteen per cent. of its gross income,
to be expended upon the upkeep of parks. Of
late years the amount has been reduced to nine per cent.
The parks are admirable.</p>

<p>Freight rates from the west to Baltimore are, I am
informed, enough lower than freight rates to New York,
Boston, or Philadelphia, to give Baltimore a decided advantage
as a point of export. Also she is admirably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
situated as to sources of coal supply. (I do not care
much for the last two items, myself, but put them in to
please the Chamber of Commerce.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is the habit of my companion and myself, when
visiting strange cities, to ask for interesting eating-places
of one sort or another. In Baltimore there seems
to be no choice but to take meals in hotels&mdash;unless one
may wish to go to the Dutch Tea room or the Woman's
Exchange for a shoppers' lunch, and to see (in the latter
establishment) great numbers of ladies sitting upon
tall stools and eating at a lunch-counter&mdash;a somewhat
curious spectacle, perhaps, but neither pleasing to the
eye nor thrilling to the senses.</p>

<p>The nearest thing to "character" which I found in a
Baltimore eating-place was at an establishment known
as Kelly's Oyster House, a place in a dark quarter of the
town. It had the all-night look about it, and the negro
waiters showed themselves not unacquainted with certain
of the city's gilded youth. Kelly's is a sort of
southern version of "Jack's"&mdash;if you know Jack's.
But I don't think Jack's has any flight of stairs to fall
down, such as Kelly's has.</p>

<p>The dining rooms of the various hotels are considerably
used, one judges, by the citizens of Baltimore. The
Kernan Hotel, which we visited one night after the
theater, looked like Broadway. Tables were crowded
together and there was dancing between them&mdash;and between
mouthfuls. So, too, at the Belvedere, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
used considerably by Baltimore's gay and fashionable
people.</p>

<p>My companion and I stayed at the Belvedere and
found it a good hotel, albeit one which has, I think,
become a shade too well accustomed to being called
good. Perhaps because of a city ordinance, perhaps
because the waiters want to go to bed, they have a
trick, in the Belvedere dining-room, during the cold
weather, of opening the windows and freezing out such
dilatory supper-guests as would fain sit up and talk.
This is a system even more effective than the ancient
one of mopping up the floors, piling chairs upon the
tables, and turning out enough lights to make the room
dull. A good post-midnight conversationalist&mdash;and
Baltimore is not without them&mdash;can stand mops, buckets,
and dim lights, but turn cold drafts upon his back and he
gives up, sends for his coat, buttons it about his paunch
and goes sadly home.</p>

<p>It is fitting that last of all should be mentioned the
man who views you with keen eye as you arrive in
Baltimore, and who watches you depart. If you are in
Baltimore he knows it. And when you go away he
knows that, too. Also, during racing season, he knows
whether you bet, and whether you won or lost. He is
always at the station and always at the race track, and
if you don't belong in Baltimore he is aware of it the
instant he sets eyes upon you, because he knows every
man, woman, child, and dog in Baltimore, and they all
know him. If you are a Baltimorean you are already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
aware that I refer to the sapient McNeal, policeman at
the Union Station.</p>

<p>McNeal and Cardinal Gibbons are, I take it, the two
pre&euml;minent figures of the city. Their duties, I admit,
are not alike, but each performs his duties with discretion,
with devotion, with distinction. The latter has already
celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of his nomination
as cardinal, but the former is well on the way
toward his fortieth anniversary as officer at the Union
Station.</p>

<p>McNeal is an artist. He loves his work. And when
his day off comes and he puts on citizen's clothing and
goes out for a good time, where do you suppose he goes?</p>

<p>Why down to the station, of course, to talk things
over with the man who is relieving him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<br />
DOUGHOREGAN MANOR AND THE CARROLLS</h2>


<p>If I am to be honest about the South, and about myself&mdash;and
I propose to be&mdash;I must admit that,
though I approached the fabled land in a most
friendly spirit, I had nevertheless become a little tired
of the southern family tree, the southern ancestral
hall, and the old southern negro servant of stage and
story, and just a little skeptical about them. Almost
unconsciously, at first, I had begun to wonder whether,
instead of being things of actuality, they were not,
rather, a mere set of romantic trade-marks, so to speak;
symbols signifying the South as the butler with side
whiskers signifies English comedy; as "Her" visit to
"His" rooms, in the third act, signifies English drama;
or as double doorways in a paneled "set" signify French
farce.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it had occurred to me that of persons
of southern accent, or merely southern extraction,
whom I had encountered in the North, a strangely high
percentage were not only of "fine old southern family,"
but of peculiarly tenacious purpose in respect to having
the matter understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot pretend to say when the "professional Southerner,"
as we know him in New York, began to operate,
nor shall I attempt to place the literary blame for his
existence&mdash;as Mark Twain attempted to place upon Sir
Walter Scott the blame for southern "chivalry," and
almost for the Civil War itself. Let me merely say,
then, that I should not be surprised to learn that "Colonel
Carter of Cartersville"&mdash;that lovable old fraud who
did not mean to be a fraud at all, but whose na&iuml;vet&eacute;
passed the bounds of human credulity&mdash;was not far removed
from the bottom of the matter.</p>

<p>In the tenor of these sentiments my companion shared&mdash;though
I should add that he complained bitterly about
agreeing with me, saying that with hats alike, and overcoats
alike, and trunks alike, and suitcases alike, we already
resembled two members of a minstrel troupe, and
that now since we were beginning to think alike, through
traveling so much together, our friends would not
be able to tell us apart when we got home again&mdash;in
spite of this he admitted to the same suspicion of the
South as I expressed. Wherefore we entered the region
like a pair of agnostics entering the great beyond:
skeptical, but ready to be "shown."</p>

<p>It was with the generous purpose of "showing" us
that a Baltimore friend of ours called for us one day
with his motor car and was presently wafting us over
the good oiled roads of Maryland, through sweet, rolling
country, which seemed to have been made to be ridden
over upon horseback.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It was autumn, but though the chill of northern
autumn was in the air, the coloring was not so high in
key as in New York or New England, the foliage being
less brilliant, but rich with subtle harmonies of brown
and green, blending softly together as in a faded tapestry,
and giving the landscape an expression of brooding
tenderness.</p>

<p>After passing through Ellicott City, an old, shambling
town quite out of character with its new-sounding
name, which has such a western ring to it, we traversed
for several miles the old Frederick Turnpike&mdash;formerly
a national highway between East and West&mdash;swooping
up and down over a series of little hills and vales, and
at length turned off into a private road winding through
a venerable forest, which was like an old Gothic cathedral
with its pavement of brown leaves and its tree-trunk
columns, tall, gray, and slender.</p>

<p>When we had progressed for perhaps a mile, we
emerged upon a slight eminence commanding a broad
view of meadow and of woodland, and in turn commanded
by a great house.</p>

<p>The house was of buff-colored brick. It was low and
very long, with wings extending from its central structure
like beautiful arms flung wide in welcome, and at
the end of each a building like an ornament balanced in
an outstretched hand. The graceful central portico,
rising by several easy steps from the driveway level, the
long line of cornice, the window sashes, the delicate
wooden railing surmounting the roof, the charming lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>tle
tower which so gracefully held its place above the
geometrical center of the house, the bell tower crowning
one wing at its extremity&mdash;all these were white.</p>

<p>No combination of colors can be lovelier, in such a
house, than yellow-buff and white, provided they be
brightened by some notes of green; and these notes were
not lacking, for several aged elms, occupying symmetrical
positions with regard to the house, seemed to gaze
down upon it with the adoration of a group of mothers,
aunts, and grandmothers, as they held their soft draperies
protectively above it. The green of the low terrace&mdash;called
a "haha," supposedly with reference to the
mirth-provoking possibilities of an accidental step over
the edge&mdash;did not reach the base of the buff walls, but
was lost in a fringe of clustering shrubbery, from which
patches of lustrous English ivy clambered upward over
the brick, to lay strong, mischievous fingers upon the
blinds of certain second-story windows. The blinds
were of course green; green blinds being as necessary
to an American window as eyelashes to an eye.</p>

<p>Immediately before the portico and centering upon it
the drive swung in a spacious circle, from which there
broke, at a point directly opposite the portico, an avenue,
straight and long as a rifle range, and lovely as
the loveliest of New England village greens. Down the
middle of this broad way, between grass borders each as
wide as a great boulevard, and double rows of patriarchal
trees, ran a road which, in the old days, continued
straight to Annapolis, thirty or more miles away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
where was the town house of the builder of this manor.
As it stands to-day the avenue is less than half a mile
long, but whatever its length, and whether one look
down it from the house, or up the gentle grade from
the far end, to where the converging lines of grass and
foliage and sky melt into the house, it has about it something
of unreality, something of enchantment, something
of that quality one finds in the rhapsodic landscapes of
those poet painters who dream of distant shimmering
palaces and supernal vistas peopled by fauns and nymphs
dancing amid the trunks of giant trees whose luxuriant
dark tops are contoured like the cumulus white clouds
floating above them.</p>

<p>There is nothing "baronial," nothing arrogant, about
Doughoregan Manor, for though the house is noble, its
nobility, consisting in spaciousness, simplicity, and grace
combined with age, fits well into what, it seems to me,
should be the architectural ideals of a republic. No
house could be freer of unessential embellishment; in detail
it is plain almost to severity; yet the full impression
that it gives, far from being austere, is of friendliness
and hospitality. An approachable sort of house, a
"homelike" house, it is perhaps less "imposing" than
some other mansions, coeval with it, in Virginia, in
Annapolis, and in Charleston; and yet it is as impressive,
in its own way, as Warwick Castle, or Hurstmonceaux,
or Loches, or Chinon, or Chenonceaux, or Heidelberg&mdash;not
that it is so vast, that it has glowering battlements,
or that it stuns the eye, but for precisely opposite rea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>sons:
because it is a consummate expression of republican
cultivation, of a fine old American home, and of
the fine old American gentleman who built it, and whose
descendants inhabit it to-day: Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
last to survive of those who signed the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p>The first Charles Carroll, known in the family as "the
Settler," came from Ireland in 1688, and became a great
landowner in Maryland. He was a highly educated
gentleman and a Roman Catholic, as have also been his
descendants. He acted as agent for Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, or "Breakneck
Carroll" (so called because he was killed by a fall
from the steps of his house), built the Carroll mansion
at Annapolis, now the property of the Redemptionist
Order.</p>

<p>The third and most famous member of the family
was Charles Carroll of Carrollton, "the Signer," builder
of the manor house at Doughoregan&mdash;which, by the
way, derives its name from a combination of the old
Irish words <i>dough</i>, meaning "house" or "court," and
<i>O'Ragan</i>, meaning "of the King"; the whole being pronounced,
as with a slight brogue, "Doo-ray-gan," the accent
falling on the middle syllable&mdash;this Charles Carroll,
"the Signer," most famous of his line, was "Breakneck's"
only son. When eight years old he was sent to
France to be educated by the Jesuits. He spent six
years at Saint-Omer, one at Rheims, two at the College
of Louis le Grand, one at Bourges, where he studied civil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
law, and after some further time in college in Paris went
to London, entered the Middle Temple and there worked
at the common law until his return to Maryland in 1765.</p>

<p>Although Maryland was founded by the Roman Catholic
Baron Baltimore on a basis of religious toleration,
the Church of England had later come to be the established
church in the British colonies in America, and
Roman Catholics were unjustly used, being disfranchised,
taxed for the support of the English Church, and
denied the right to establish schools or churches of their
own, to celebrate the Mass, or to bear arms&mdash;the bearing
of arms having been "at that time the insignia of social
position and gentle breeding."</p>

<p>Finding this situation well-nigh intolerable, Carroll
of Carrollton, already a man of great wealth, joined
with his cousin, Father John Carroll, who later became
first Archbishop of Baltimore (for many years
the only Roman Catholic diocese in the United States,
embracing all States and Territories), in an appeal to
the King of France for a grant of land in what is now
Arkansas, but was then a part of Louisiana, this land
to be used as a refuge for Roman Catholics and Jesuits,
whom the Carrolls proposed to lead thither precisely as
Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore, had led them to Maryland
to escape persecution.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics were not, however, by this time
the only American colonists who felt themselves abused;
the whole country was chafing, and the seeds of revolution
were beginning to show their red sprouts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been expected that Mr. Carroll, being
the richest man in the country, would hesitate at rebellion,
but he did not. Unlike some of our present-day
citizens of foreign extraction, and in circumstances involving
not merely sentiment, but property and perhaps
life, he showed no tendency to split his Americanism, but
boldly threw his noble old cocked hat into the ring. Nor
did he require a Roosevelt to make his duty clear to him.</p>

<p>In 1775 Mr. Carroll was a delegate to the Revolutionary
Convention of Maryland; in 1776 he went with
three other commissioners (Benjamin Franklin, Samuel
Chase, and Father John Carroll) to try to induce the
Canadian colonies to join in the revolt; and soon after
his return from this unsuccessful journey he signed the
Declaration of Independence. Of the circumstances of
the signing the late Robert C. Winthrop of Boston gave
the following description:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Will you sign?" said Hancock to Charles Carroll.</p>

<p>"Most willingly," was the reply.</p>

<p>"There goes two millions with the dash of a pen," says one of
those standing by; while another remarks: "Oh, Carroll, you will
get off, there are so many Charles Carrolls."</p>

<p>And then we may see him stepping back to the desk and putting
that addition "of Carrollton" to his name, which will designate
him forever, and be a prouder title of nobility than those in the
peerage of Great Britain, which were afterward adorned by his
accomplished and fascinating granddaughters.</p></div>

<p>Some doubt has been cast upon this tale by the fact
that papers in possession of the Carroll family prove
that Mr. Carroll was wont to sign as "of Carrollton"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
long before the Declaration. Further, it is recorded
that John H.&nbsp;B. Latrobe, Mr. Carroll's contemporaneous
biographer, never heard the story from the subject of his
writings.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I believe that it is true, for it seems to
me likely that though Mr. Carroll used the subscription
"of Carrollton" in conducting his affairs at home,
where there was chance for confusion between his son
Charles, his cousin Charles, and himself, he might well
have been inclined to omit it from a public document, as
to the signers of which there could be no confusion.
Further, the fact that he never told the story to Latrobe
does not invalidate it, for as every man (and every
man's wife) knows, men do not remember to tell everything
to their wives, and it is still less likely that
they tell everything to their biographers. Further still,
Mr. Winthrop visited Mr. Carroll just before the latter's
death, and as he certainly did not invent the story
it seems probable that he got it from "the Signer" himself.
Last, I like the story and intend to believe it anyway&mdash;which,
it occurs to me, is the best reason of all, and
the one most resembling my reason for being more or
less Episcopalian and Republican.</p>

<p>Latrobe tells us that Mr. Carroll was, in his old age,
"a small, attenuated old man, with a prominent nose and
somewhat receding chin, and small eyes that sparkled
when he was interested in conversation. His head was
small and his hair white, rather long and silky, while
his face and forehead were seamed with wrinkles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>From the same source, and others, we glean the information
that he was a charming and courteous gentleman,
that he practised early rising and early retiring,
was regular at meals, and at morning and evening prayer
in the chapel, that he took cold baths and rode horseback,
and that for several hours each day he read the
Greek, Latin, English, or French classics.</p>

<p>At the age of eighty-three he rode a horse in a procession
in Baltimore, carrying in one hand a copy of the
Declaration of Independence; and six years later, when
by that strange freak of chance ex-Presidents Adams
and Jefferson died simultaneously on July 4, leaving Mr.
Carroll the last surviving signer of the Declaration, he
took part in a memorial parade and service in their
memory. In 1826, at the age of eighty-nine, he was
elected a director of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
Company, and at the age of ninety he laid the foundation
stone marking the commencement of that railroad&mdash;the
first important one in the United States.
We are told that at this time Mr. Carroll was erect in
carriage and that he could see and hear as well as most
men. In 1832, having lived to within five years of a
full century, having been active in the Revolution, having
seen the War of 1812, he died less than thirty years before
the outbreak of the Civil War, and was buried in
the chapel of the manor house.</p>

<p>This chapel, the like of which does not, so far as I
know, exist in any other American house, is the burial
place of a number of the Carrolls. It is used to-day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
regular Sunday services being held for the people of the
neighborhood. An alcove to the south of the chancel
contains seats for members of the family, and has access
to the main portion of the house by a passageway which
passes the bedroom known as the Cardinal's room, a
large chamber furnished with massive old pieces of mahogany
and decorated in red. This room has been occupied
by Lafayette, by John Carroll, cousin of "the
Signer" and first archbishop of Baltimore, and by Cardinal
Gibbons. It is on the ground floor and its windows
command the series of terraces, with their plantings
of old box, which slope away to gardens more than
a century old.</p>

<p>Viewed in one light Doughoregan Manor is a monument,
in another it is a treasure house of ancient portraits
and furniture and silver, but above all it is a home.
The beautifully proportioned dining-room, the wide hall
which passes through the house from the front portico
to another overlooking the terraces and gardens at the
back, the old shadowy library with its tree-calf bindings,
the sunny breakfast room, the spacious bedchambers
with their four-posters and their cheerful chintzes,
the big bright shiny pantries and kitchens, all have that
pleasant, easy air which comes of being lived in, and
which is never attained in a "show place" which is
merely a "show place" and nothing more. No dining
table at which great personages have dined in the past
has the charm of one the use of which has been steadily
continued; no old chair but is better for being sat in; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
ancient Sheffield tea service but gains immeasurably in
charm from being used for tea to-day; no old Venetian
mirror but what is lovelier for reflecting the beauties of
the present as it reflected those of the past; no little old-time
crib but what is better for a modern baby in it. It
is pleasant, therefore, to report that, like all other things
the house contains, the crib at Doughoregan Manor was
being used when we were there, for in it rested the baby
son of the house; by name Charles, and of his line the
ninth. Further, it may be observed that from his
youthful parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bancroft Carroll,
present master and mistress of the place, Master
Charles seemed to have inherited certain amiable traits.
Indeed, in some respects, he outdoes his parents. For
example, where the father and mother were cordial, the
son chewed ruminatively upon his fingers and fastened
upon my companion a gaze not merely interested,
but expressive of enraptured astonishment. Likewise,
though his parents received us kindly, they did not crow
and gurgle with delight; and though, on our departure,
they said that we might come again, they neither waved
their hands nor yet blew bubbles.</p>

<span class="caption">Doughoregan Manor&mdash;The house was of buff-colored brick. It was low and very long, with wings extending from

</div>

<p>Though the house has been "done over" four times,
and though the paneling was torn out of one room
to make way for wall paper when wall paper came into
style, everything has now been restored, and the place
stands to-day to all intents and purposes exactly as it
was. That so few changes were ever made in it, that it
weathered successfully, with its contents, the disastrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
period of Eastlake furniture and the American mansard
roof, is a great credit to the Carroll family, and it is delightful
to see such a house in the possession of those
who can love it as it deserves to be loved, and preserve
it as it deserves to be preserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Bancroft Carroll, who is a graduate of
Annapolis and a grandson of the late Governor John Lee
Carroll of Maryland, now farms some twenty-four hundred
acres of the five or six thousand which surround the
manor house. He raises blooded cattle and horses, and,
though he rides with the Elkridge Hunt, also keeps his
own pack and is starting the Howard County Hounds,
an organization that will hunt the country around the
manor, which is full of foxes.</p>

<p>Of the innumerable family portraits contained in the
house not a few are valuable and almost all are pleasing.
When I remarked upon the high average of good looks
among his progenitors, Mr. Carroll smiled in agreement,
saying: "Yes, I'm proud of these pictures of my
ancestors; most people's ancestors seem to have looked
like the dickens."</p>

<p>Among these noteworthy family portraits I recollect
one of "the Signer" as a boy, standing on the shore and
watching a ship sail out to sea; one of the three beautiful
Caton sisters, his granddaughters, who lived at
Brooklandwood, in the Green Spring Valley, now the
home of Mr. Isaac Emerson; one of Charles Carroll of
Homewood, son of "the Signer"; and one of Governor
John Lee Carroll, who was born at Homewood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The Caton sisters and Charles Carroll of Homewood
supply to the Carroll family archives that picturesqueness
which the history of every old family should possess;
the former contributing beauty, the latter dash and
extravagance, those qualities so annoying in a living
relative, but so delightfully suggestive in an ancestor
long defunct. If anything more be needed to round out
the composition, it is furnished by the ghosts of Doughoregan
Manor: an old housekeeper with jingling keys,
and an invisible coach, the wheels of which are heard
upon the driveway before the death of any member of
the family.</p>

<p>Of the Caton sisters there were four, but because one
of them, Mrs. McTavish, stayed at home and made the
life of her grandfather happy, we do not hear so much of
her as of the other three, who were internationally
famous for their pulchritude, and were known in England
as "the Three American Graces." All three married
British peers, one becoming Marchioness of Wellesley,
another Duchess of Leeds, while the third became
the wife of Lord Stafford, one of the noblemen embalmed
in verse by Fitz-Greene Halleck:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lord Stafford mines for coal and salt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duke of Norfolk deals in malt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Douglas in red herrings.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for Charles Carroll of Homewood, he was handsome,
charming, and athletic, and, as indicated in letters
written to him by his father, caused that old gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>man
a good deal of anxiety. It is said that at one time&mdash;perhaps
during some period of estrangment from his
wealthy parent&mdash;he acted as a fencing master in Baltimore.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-five he settled down&mdash;or let us
hope he did&mdash;for he married Harriet Chew, whose sister
"Peggy," Mrs. John Eager Howard of Baltimore, was a
celebrated belle, and of whose own charm we may judge
by the fact that General Washington asked her to remain
in the room while he sat to Gilbert Stuart, declaring that
her presence there would cause his countenance to "wear
its most agreeable expression." The famous portrait
painted under these felicitous conditions hung in the
White House when, in 1814, the British marched on
Washington; but when they took the city and burned the
White House, the portrait did not perish with it,
for history records that Dolly Madison carried it to
safety, and along with it the original draft of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p>Charles Carroll of Homewood died before his father,
"the Signer," but the house, Homewood, which the latter
built for his son and daughter-in-law in 1809, stands
to-day near the Baltimore city limits, at the side of
Charles Street Boulevard, amid pleasant modern houses,
many of which are of a design not out of harmony with
the old mansion. Though not comparable in size with
the manor house at Doughoregan, Homewood is an even
more perfect house, being one of the finest examples of
Georgian architecture to be found in the entire country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
The fate of this house is hardly less fortunate than that
of the paternal manor, for, with its surrounding lands, it
has come into the possession of Johns Hopkins University.
The fields of Homewood now form the campus
and grounds of that excellent seat of learning, and the
trustees of the university have not merely preserved
the residence, using it as a faculty club, but have had the
inspiration to find in it the architectural motif for the entire
group of new college buildings, so that the campus
may be likened to a bracelet wrought as a setting for
this jewel of a house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<br />
A RARE OLD TOWN</h2>


<p>The drive from Baltimore to the sweet, slumbering
city of Annapolis is over a good road, but
through barren country. Taken in the crisp
days of autumn, by a northern visitor sufficiently misguided
to have supposed that beyond Mason and
Dixon's Line the winters are tropical it may prove an
uncomfortable drive&mdash;unless he be able to borrow a
fur overcoat. It was on this drive that my disillusionment
concerning the fall and winter climate of the South
began, for, wearing two cloth overcoats, one over the
other, I yet suffered agonies from cold. The sun shone
down upon the open automobile in which we tore along,
but its rays were no competitors for the biting wind.
Through lap robes, cloth caps, and successive layers of
clothing, and around the edges of goggles, fine little
frozen fangs found their way, like the pliable beaks of a
race of gigantic, fabulous mosquitoes from the Arctic
regions. I have driven an open car over the New England
snows for miles in zero weather, and been warm
by comparison, because I was prepared.</p>

<p>My former erroneous ideas as to the southern climate
may be shared by others, and it is therefore well, per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>haps,
to enlarge a little bit upon the subject. Never,
except during a winter passed in a stone tile-floored villa
on the island of Capri, whither I went to escape the cold,
have I been so conscious of it, as during fall, winter, and
spring in the South.</p>

<p>In the hotels of the South one may keep warm in cold
weather, but in private homes it is not always possible
to do so, for the popular illusion that the "sunny South"
is of a uniformly temperate climate in the winter persists
nowhere more violently than in the South itself.
Many a house in Virginia, let alone the other States farther
down the map, is without a furnace, and winter life
in such houses, with their ineffectual wood fires, is like
life in a refrigerator tempered by the glow of a safety
match. As in Italy and Spain, so in the South it is often
warmer outdoors than in; more than once during my
southern voyage I was tempted to resume the habit, acquired
in Capri, of wearing an overcoat in the house and
taking it off on going out into the sunshine. True, in
Capri we had roses blooming in the garden on Christmas
Day, but that circumstance, far from proving warmth,
merely proved the hardiness of roses. So, in the far
South&mdash;excepting Florida and perhaps a strip of the
Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama&mdash;the
blooming of flowers in the winter does not prove that
"Palm Beach suits" and panama hats invariably make a
desirable uniform.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am inclined to believe that because
some southern winter days are warm and others cold, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Northerner feels cold in the South more than he feels
the corresponding temperature at home&mdash;on somewhat
the principle which caused the Italians who went with
the Duke of the Abruzzi on his polar expedition to withstand
cold more successfully than did the Scandinavians.</p>

<p>Of the southern summer I have no experience, but I
have been repeatedly assured that certain of the southern
beaches are nearly, if not quite, as comfortable in hot
weather as are those of New Jersey or Long Island,
while in numerous southern mountain retreats one may
be fairly cool through the hot months&mdash;a fact which
spells fortune for the hotel keepers of such high-perched
resorts as Asheville, White Sulphur Springs, and the
Hot Springs of Virginia, who have their houses full of
Northerners in winter and Southerners in summer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The experience of arrival in Annapolis, delightful in
any weather and at any time of year, gives one a satisfaction
almost ecstatic after a cold, windy automobile
ride such as we had suffered. To ache for the shelter of
almost any town, or any sort of building, and, with such
yearnings, to arrive in this dreamy city, whose mild air
seems to be compounded from fresh winds off a glittering
blue sea, arrested by the barricade of ancient hospitable-looking
houses, warmed by the glow of their sun-baked
red brick, and freighted with a ghostly fragrance,
as from the phantoms of the rose gardens of a century
or two ago&mdash;to arrive, frigid and forlorn in such a haven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to drink a cup of tea in the old Paca house (now a hotel),
is to experience heaven after purgatory. For there is
no town that I know whose very house fronts hold out
to the stranger that warm, old-fashioned welcome that
Annapolis seems to give.</p>

<p>The Paca house, which as a hotel has acquired the
name Carvel Hall, is the house that Winston Churchill
had in mind as the Manners house, of his novel "Richard
Carvel." A good idea of the house, as it was, may be
obtained by visiting the Brice house, next door, for the
two are almost twins. When Mr. Churchill was a cadet
at Annapolis, before the modern part of the Carvel Hall
hotel was built, there were the remains of terraced gardens
back of the old mansion, stepping down to an old
spring house, and a rivulet which flowed through the
grounds was full of watercress. The book describes a
party at the house and in these gardens. The Chase
house on Maryland Avenue was the one Mr. Churchill
thought of as the home of Lionel Carvel, and he described
the view from upper windows of this house, over
the Harwood house, across the way, to the Severn.</p>

<p>Annapolis, Baedeker tells me, was the first chartered
city in the United States, having been granted its charter
by Queen Anne considerably more than two centuries
ago. It is, as every little boy and girl should know, the
capital of Maryland, and is built around a little hill upon
the top of which stands the old State House in which
Washington surrendered his commission and in which
met the first Constitutional Convention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>In its prime Annapolis was nearly as large a city as it
is to-day, but that is not saying a great deal, for at the
present time it has not so many inhabitants as Amarillo,
Texas, or Brazil, Indiana.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the life of Annapolis in colonial days,
and in the days which followed them, was very brilliant,
and we learn from the diary of General Washington and
from the writings of amazed Englishmen and Frenchmen
who visited the city in its period of glory that there
were dinners and balls night after night, that the theater
was encouraged in Annapolis more than in any other
city, that the race meets compared with English race
meets both as to the quality of the horses and of the
fashionable attendance, that there were sixteen clubs,
that the women of the city were beautiful, charming, and
superbly dressed, that slaves in sumptuous liveries were
to be seen about the streets, that certain gentlemen paid
calls in barges which were rowed by half a dozen or
more blacks, in uniform, and that the perpetual hospitality
of the great houses was gorgeous and extravagant.</p>

<p>The houses hint of these things. If you have seen the
best old brick mansions of New England, and will
imagine them more beautifully proportioned, set off by
balancing wings and having infinitely finer details as to
doorways, windows, porticos, and also as to wood carvings
and fixtures within&mdash;as, for instance, the beautiful
silver latches and hinges of the Chase house at Annapolis&mdash;you
will gather something of the flavor of these
old Southern homes. For though such venerable man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>sions
as the Chase, Paca, Brice, Hammond, Ridout, and
Bordley houses, in Annapolis, are not without family
resemblance to the best New England colonial houses,
the resemblance is of a kind to emphasize the differences,
not only between the mansions of the North and
South, but between the builders of them. The contrast
is subtle, but marked.</p>

<p>Your New England house, beautiful as it is, is stamped
with austere simplicity. The man who built it was
probably a scholar but he was almost certainly a Calvinist.
He habited himself in black and was served by
serving maids, instead of slaves in livery. If a woman
was not flat-chested and forlorn, he was prone to regard
her as the devil masquerading for the downfall
of man&mdash;and no doubt with some justice, too. Night
and morning he presided at family prayers, the purpose
of which was to impress upon his family and servants
that to have a good time was wicked, and that to be gay
in this life meant hell-fire and damnation in the next.</p>

<p>Upon this pious person his cousin of Annapolis looked
with something not unlike contempt; for the latter,
though he too was a scholar, possessed the sort of
scholarliness which takes into account beauty and the
lore of cosmopolitanism. He may have been religious
or he may not have been, but if religious he demanded
something handsome, something stylish, in his religion,
as he did also in his residence, in his wife, his sons, his
daughters, his horses, coaches, dinners, wines, and
slaves. He did things with a flourish, and was not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>set
by a perpetual consciousness and fear of hell. He
approved of pretty women; he made love to them; he
married them; he was the father of them. His pretty
daughters married men who also admired pretty women,
and became the mothers of other pretty women, who
became, in turn, the mothers and grandmothers of the
pretty women of the South to-day.</p>

<p>Your old-time Annapolis gentleman's ideas of a republic
were far indeed from those now current, for he
understood perfectly the difference between a republic
and a democracy&mdash;a difference which is not now so well
understood. He believed that the people should elect
the heads of the government, but he also believed that
these heads should be elected from his own class, and
that, having voted, the people should go about their business,
trusting their betters to run the country as it should
be run.</p>

<p>This, at least, is my picture of the old aristocrats of
Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, as conveyed to
me by what I have seen of their houses and possessions
and what I have read of their mode of life. They were
the early princes of the Republic and by all odds its
most picturesque figures.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Very different from the spirit of appreciation and
emulation shown by the trustees of Johns Hopkins University
with regard to the old house, Homewood, in
Baltimore, is that manifested in the architecture of the
Naval Academy at Annapolis, where, in a city fairly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
flooded with examples of buildings, both beautiful and
typically American, architectural hints were ignored,
and there were erected great stone structures whose
chief characteristics are size, solidity, and the look of
being "government property." The main buildings of
the Academy, with the exception of the chapel, suggest
the sort of sublimated penitentiary that Mr. Thomas
Mott Osborne might, one fancies, construct under a
carte-blanche authorization, while the chapel, the huge
dome of which is visible to all the country round, makes
one think of a monstrous wedding cake fashioned in the
form of a building and covered with white and yellow
frosting in ornamental patterns.</p>

<p>This chapel, one imagines, may have been inspired by
the Invalides in Paris, but of the Invalides it falls far
short. I know nothing of the history of the building,
but it is easy to believe that the original intention may
have been to place at the center of it, under the dome, a
great well, over the parapet of which might have been
seen the sarcophagus of John Paul Jones, in the crypt.
One prefers to think that the architect had some such
plan; for the crypt, as at present arranged, is hardly
more than a dark cellar, approached by what seems to
be a flight of humble back stairs. To descend into it,
and find there the great marble coffin with its bronze
dolphins, is not unlike going down into the cellar of a
residence and there discovering the family silver reposing
in the coal-bin.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to recall the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that our sometimes piratical and always brilliant Revolutionary
naval hero died in Paris, and that until a few
years ago his resting place was unknown. The reader
will remember that while General Horace Porter was
American ambassador to France a search was instituted
for the remains of John Paul Jones, the greater
part of the work having been conducted by Colonel H.
Baily Blanchard, then first secretary of the Embassy,
assisted by the ambassador and Mr. Henry Vignaud,
dean of secretaries of embassy. The resting place of
Jones was finally discovered in an abandoned cemetery
in the city of Paris, over which houses had been built.
The body was contained in a leaden casket and was preserved
in alcohol so that identification was easily accomplished
by means of a contemporaneous likeness of
Jones, and also by means of measurements taken from
Houdin's bust. The remains were accorded military
honors in Paris, and were brought to this country on a
war vessel.</p>

<p>Why the crypt at Annapolis is as it is, I do not know,
but in my own purely imaginary picture of what happened,
I see the architect's plans for a heroic display of
Jones's tomb knocked on the head by some "practical
man," some worthy dunce in the Navy Department,
whom I can imagine as protesting: "But no! We
can't take up space at the center of the chapel for any
such purpose. It must be floored over to make room for
pews. Otherwise where will the cadets sit?"</p>

<p>So, although the grounds of the academy, with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
lawns, and aged trees, and squirrels, and cadets, are
charming, and although the solemn and industrious
Baedeker assures me that the academy is the "chief lion"
of Annapolis, and although I know that it is a great
school, and that we need another like it in order properly
to officer our navy, I prefer the old town with its old
houses, and old streets bearing such reminiscent names
as Hanover, Prince George, and Duke of Gloucester.</p>

<p>For certain slang expressions used by cadets I am indebted
to a member of the corps. From this admiral-to-be
I learn that a "bird" or "wazzo" is a man or boy;
that a "pap sheet" is a report covering delinquencies,
and that to "hit the pap" is to be reported for delinquency;
that "steam" is marine engineering, and to be
"bilged for juice" is to fail in examinations in electrical
engineering&mdash;to get an "unsat," or unsatisfactory mark,
or even a "zip" or "swabo," which is a zero. Cadets do
not escort girls to dances, but "drag" them; a girl is a
"drag," and a "heavy drag" or "brick" is an unattractive
girl who must be taken to a dance. A "sleuth" or
"jimmylegs" is a night watchman, and to be "ragged" is
to be caught. Mess-hall waiters are sometimes called
"mokes," while at other times the names of certain exalted
dignitaries of the Navy Department, or of the
academy, are applied to them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I shall never cease to regret that dread of the cold kept
us from seeing ancient Whitehall, a few miles from Annapolis,
which was the residence of Governor Horatio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Sharpe, and is one of the finest of historic American
homes; nor shall I, on the other hand, ever cease to
rejoice that, in spite of cold we did, upon another day,
visit Hampton, the rare old mansion of the Ridgelys, of
Maryland, which stands amid its own five thousand acres
some dozen miles or so to the north of Baltimore. The
Ridgelys were, it appears, the great Protestant land
barons of this region as the Carrolls were the great
Catholics, and, like the Carrolls, they remain to-day the
proprietors of a vast estate and an incomparable house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Hampton is probably the largest of Maryland's
old mansions, and the beauty of it is more
theatrical than the beauty of Doughoregan
Manor; for although the latter is the older of the two,
the former is not only spectacular by reason of its
spaciousness, the delicacy of its architectural details, and
the splendor of its dreamlike terraced gardens, but also
for a look of beautiful, dignified, yet somehow tragic
age&mdash;a look which makes one think of a wonderful old
lady; a belle of the days of minuets and powdered wigs
and patches; a woman no less wonderful in her declining
years than in her youth, but wonderful in another way;
a proud old aristocrat, erect and spirited to the last;
her bedchamber a storehouse of ivory lace and ancient
jewelry, her memory a storehouse of recollections, like
chapters from romantic novels of the days when all men
were gallant, and all women beautiful: recollections of
journeys made in the old coach, which is still in the
stable, though its outriders have been buried in the
slaves' burying ground these many years; recollections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the opening of Hampton, when, as the story goes,
gay Captain Charles Ridgely, builder of the house, held a
card party in the attic to celebrate the event, while his
wife, Rebecca Dorsey Ridgely, a lady of religious turn,
marked the occasion simultaneously with a prayer-meeting
in the drawing room; of the ball given by the
Ridgelys in honor of Charles Carroll's granddaughters,
the exquisite Caton sisters; of hunt meets here, long,
long ago, and hunt balls which succeeded them; of
breakneck rides; of love-making in that garden peopled
with the ghosts of more than a century of lovers; of duels
fought at dawn. Of such vague, thrilling tales the old
house seems to whisper.</p>

<p>Never, from the moment we turned into the tree-lined
avenue, leading to Hampton, from the moment when I
saw the fox hounds rise resentfully out of beds which
they had dug in drifts of oak leaves in the drive, from
the moment when I stood beneath the stately portico and
heard the bars of the shuttered doors being flung back
for our admittance&mdash;never, from my first glimpse of the
place, have I been able to dispel the sense of unreality I
felt while there, and which makes me feel, now, that
Hampton is not a house that I have seen, but one built
by my imagination in the course of a particularly charming
and convincing dream.</p>

<p>Stained glass windows bearing the Ridgely coat of
arms flank the front doorway, and likewise the opposing
doorway at the end of the enormous hall upon which one
enters, and the light from these windows gives the hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a subdued yet glowing illumination, so that there is
something spectral about the old chairs and the old portraits
with which the walls are solidly covered. There
are portraits here by Gilbert Stuart and other distinguished
painters of times gone by, and I particularly
remember one large canvas showing a beautiful young
woman in evening dress, her hair hanging in curls beside
her cheeks, her tapering fingers touching the strings
of a harp. She was young then; yet the portrait is that
of the great-grandmother, or great-great-grandmother,
of present Ridgelys, and she has lain long in the brick-walled
family burying ground below the garden. But
there beneath the portrait stands the harp on which she
played.</p>

<p>One might tell endlessly of paneling, of the delicate
carving of mantels and overmantels, of chairs, tables,
desks, and sofas of Chippendale, Hepplewhite, Phyfe
and Sheraton, yet giving such an inventory one might
fail utterly to suggest the feeling of that great house,
with its sense of homelike emptiness, its wealth of old
furniture and portraits, blending together, in the dim
light of a late October afternoon, to form shadowy
backgrounds for autumnal reverie, or for silent, solitary
listening&mdash;listening to the tales told by the soughing
wind outside, to the whisper of embers in the fireplace,
the slow somber tick of the tall clock telling of ages past
and passing, the ghostly murmur of the old house talking
softly to itself.</p>

<p>From the windows of the great dining-room one looks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
away toward Hampton Gate, a favorite meeting place
for the Elkridge Hunt, or, at another angle, toward the
stables where the hunters are kept, the old slave cabins,
and the overseer's house, with its bell tower&mdash;a house
nearly two hundred years old. But the library is perhaps
the more natural resting place for the guest, and
it looks out over the garden, with its enormous descending
terraces, its geometrical walks and steps, its beautiful
old trees, and arbors of ancient box. Such terraces
as these were never built by paid labor.</p>

<p>We were given tea in the library, our hostess at this
function being a young lady of five or six years&mdash;a
granddaughter of Captain John Ridgely, present master
of Hampton&mdash;who, with her pink cheeks, her serious
eyes and demeanor, looked like a canvas by Sir Joshua
come to life, as she sat in a large chair and ate a large
red apple.</p>

<p>Nor did Bryan, Captain Ridgely's negro butler, fit
less admirably into the pervasive atmosphere of fiction
which enveloped the place. In the absence of his master,
Bryan did the honors of the old house with a style which
was not "put on," because it did not have to be put on&mdash;nature
and a good bringing-up having supplied all needs
in this respect. There was about him none of that
affectation of being a graven image, which one so often
notices in white butlers and footmen imported from Europe
by rich Americans, and which, of all shams, is one
of the most false and absurd, as carried out on both
sides&mdash;for we pretend to think these functionaries the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
deft mechanisms, incapable of thought, that they pretend
to be; yet all the time we know&mdash;and they know we
know&mdash;that they see and hear and think as we do, and
that, moreover, they are often enough observant cynics
whose elaborate gentility is assumed for hire, like the
signboard of a sandwich man.</p>

<p>Bryan was without these artificial graces. His manner,
in showing us the house, in telling us about the various
portraits, indicated some true appreciation of the
place and of its contents; and the air he wore of natural
dignity and courtesy&mdash;of being at once acting-host and
servitor&mdash;constituted as graceful a performance in a not
altogether easy r&ocirc;le as I have ever seen, and satisfied me,
once for all, as to the verity of legends concerning the
admirable qualities of old-time negro servants in the
South.</p>

<p>After tea, when fading twilight had deepened the
shadows in the house, we went up the stairway, past the
landing with its window containing the armorial bearings
of the family in stained glass, and, achieving the
upper hall, crossed to a great bedchamber, the principal
guest room, and paused just inside the door.</p>

<p>And now, because of what I am about to relate, I
shall give the names of those who were present. We
were: Dr. Murray P. Brush, A.&nbsp;B., Ph.D., acting Dean
of Johns Hopkins University; Dr. John McF. Bergland
of Baltimore; my companion, Wallace Morgan, illustrator;
and myself.</p>

<p>The light had, by this time, melted to a mere faint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
grayness sifting like mist through the many oblong
panes of several large windows. Nevertheless I could
discern that it was a spacious room, and from the
color of it and certain shadowy lines upon the walls, I
judged that it was paneled to the ceiling in white-painted
wood. I am under the impression that it contained a
fireplace, and that the great four-post bed, standing to
the right of the doorway, was placed upon a low platform,
a step or two above the floor&mdash;though of this I
am not quite certain, the bulk of the bed and the dim
light having, perhaps, deceived me. The rest of the
furniture in the room was dark in color, and massed in
heavy vague spots against the lighter background of
the walls.</p>

<p>Directly before the door, at about the center of the
wall against which it was backed, stood something which
loomed tall and dark, and which I took to be either a
gigantic clothespress or a closet built into the room.
Looking past the front of this obstruction, I saw one of
the windows; the piece of furniture was therefore exhibited
sidewise, in silhouette.</p>

<p>I do not think that I had definitely thought of ghost
stories before, and I know that ghosts had not been
spoken of, but as I looked into this room, and reflected
on the long series of persons who had occupied it, and on
where they were now, and on all the stories that the
room must have heard, there entered my mind thoughts
of the supernatural.</p>

<p>Having taken a step or two into the room, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a little in advance of my three friends, and as these
fancies came strongly to me, I spoke over my shoulder
to one of them, who was at my right and a little behind
me, saying, half playfully:</p>

<p>"There ought to be ghosts in a room like this."</p>

<p>Hardly had I spoken when without a sound, and
swinging very slowly, the door of the large piece of
furniture before me gently opened. My first idea was
that the thing must be a closet, built against the wall,
with a door at the back opening on a passageway, or
into the next room, and that the little girl whom we had
met downstairs had opened it from the other side and
was coming in.</p>

<p>I fully expected to see her enter. But she did not
enter, for, as I learned presently, she was in the nursery
at the time.</p>

<p>After waiting for an instant to see who was coming,
I began to realize that there was no one coming; that no
one had opened the door; that, like an actor picking up a
cue, the door had begun to swing immediately upon my
saying the word "ghosts."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">

<span class="caption">I began to realize that there was no one coming; that no one had opened the door;
that it had begun to swing immediately upon my saying the word &quot;ghosts&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The appropriateness of the coincidence was striking.
I turned quickly to my friends, who were in conversation
behind me, and asked:</p>

<p>"Speaking of ghosts&mdash;did you see that door open?"</p>

<p>It is my recollection that none of them had seen it.
Certainly not more than one of them had, for I remember
my feeling of disappointment that any one present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
should have missed so strange a circumstance. Some
one may have asked what I had seen; at all events I
was full of the idea, and, indicating the open door, I
began to tell what I had seen, when&mdash;exactly as though
the thing were done deliberately to circumstantiate my
story&mdash;with the slow, steady movement of a heavy door
pushed by a feeble hand, the other portal of the huge
cabinet swung open.</p>

<p>This time all four of us were looking.</p>

<p>Presently, as we moved across the wide hall to go
downstairs again, Bryan came from one of the other
chambers, whither, I think, he had carried the young
lady's supper on a tray.</p>

<p>"Are there supposed to be any ghosts in this house?" I
asked him.</p>

<p>Bryan showed his white teeth in the semi-darkness.
Whether he believed in ghosts or not, evidently he did
not fear them.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said. "We're supposed to have a ghost
here."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In that room over there," he answered, indicating the
bedroom from which we had come.</p>

<p>We listened attentively to Bryan while he told how
the daughter of Governor Swan had come to attend a
ball at Hampton, and how she had died in the four-post
bed in that old shadowy guest room, and of how, since
then, she had been seen from time to time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"They's several people say they saw her," he finished.
"She comes out and combs her hair in front of the long
mirror."</p>

<p>However, as we drove back to Baltimore that evening,
we repeatedly assured one another that we did not
believe in ghosts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<br />
ARE WE STANDARDIZED?</h2>


<p>Almost all modern European critics of the
United States agree in complaining that our telephones
and sleeping cars are objectionable, and
that we are "standardized" in everything. Their
criticism of the telephone seems to be that the state of
perfection to which it has been brought in this country
causes it to be widely used, while their disapproval of
our sleeping cars is invariably based on the assumption
that they have no compartments&mdash;which is not the fact,
since most of the great transcontinental railroads do run
compartment cars, and much better ones than the best
<i>wagons lits</i>, and since, also, all our sleeping cars have
drawing-rooms which are incomparably better than the
most comfortable European compartments.</p>

<p>The charge of standardization will, however, bear
a little thought. It is true that most American cities
have a general family resemblance&mdash;that a business
street in Atlanta or Memphis looks much like a business
street in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, Milwaukee,
St. Paul, Kansas City, or St. Louis&mdash;and that much the
same thing may be said of residence streets. Houses
and office buildings in one city are likely to resemble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
those of corresponding grade in another; the men who
live in the houses and go daily to the offices are also
similar; so are the trolley cars in which they journey
to and fro; still more so the Fords which many of them
use; the clothing of one man is like that of another, and
all have similar conventions concerning the date at which&mdash;without
regard to temperature&mdash;straw hats should be
discarded. Their womenfolk, also, are more or less
alike, as are the department stores in which they shop
and the dresses they buy. And the same is true of their
children, the costumes of those children, and the schools
they attend.</p>

<p>Every American city has social groups corresponding
to similar groups in other cities. There is always the
small, affluent group, made up of people who keep butlers
and several automobiles, and who travel extensively.
In this group there are always some snobs: ladies who
give much time to societies founded on ancestry, and
have a Junkerish feeling about "social leadership."</p>

<p>Every city has also its "fast" group: people who
consider themselves "unconventional," who drink more
than is good for them, and make much noise. Some
members of this group may belong to the first group,
as well, but in the fast group they have a following
of well-dressed hangers-on: unmarried men and
women, youngish rather than young, who, with little
money, yet manage to dress well and to be seen eating
and drinking and dancing in public places. There is
usually to be found in this group a hectic widow or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>&mdash;be
it grass or sod&mdash;and a few pretty girls who, having
been given too much freedom at eighteen, begin
to wonder at twenty-eight, why, though they have always
been "good fellows," none of the dozens of men
who take them about have married them. To this
aggregation drift also those restless husbands and wives
whose glances rove hopefully away from their mates, a
few well-bred drunkards, and a few men and women
who are trying to forget things they cannot forget.</p>

<p>Then there is always the young married group&mdash;a
nice group for the most part&mdash;living in comfortable new
houses or apartments, and keeping, usually, both a small
automobile and a baby carriage. They also go to the Country
Club on Saturday nights, leave their motors standing
in the drive, eat a lukewarm supper that tastes like
papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, and dance themselves to wiltedness.</p>

<p>Another group is entirely masculine, being made up
of husbands of various ages, their mutual bond being
the downtown club to which they go daily, and in which
the subjects discussed are politics, golf, and the evils of
prohibition. To this group always belong the black-sheep
husbands who, after taking their wives to the
Country Club, disappear and remain away until they are
sent for because it is time to go home, when they come
back shamefaced and scented with Scotch.</p>

<p>Every American city has also what Don Marquis
calls its "little group of serious thinkers"&mdash;women, most
of them&mdash;possessed of an ardent desire to "keep abreast
of the times." These women belong to clubs and lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>erary
societies which are more serious than war. They
are always reading papers or attending lectures, and
at these lectures they get a strange assortment of
"cultural" information and misinformation, delivered
with ghastly assurance by heterogeneous gentlemen in
cutaway coats, who go about and spout for pay. If you
meet these ladies, and they suspect you of being infested
by the germs of "culture," they will open fire on you
with a "thought," about which you may detect a curious
ghostly fragrance, as of Alfred Noyes's lecture, last
week, or of "the New Republic" or the "Literary Digest."
The most "liberal" of them may even take "The
Masses," precisely as people rather like them used to
take "The Philistine," a generation or two ago. Among
the members of this group are the women who work
violently for suffrage&mdash;something in which I personally
believe, but which, merely because I believe in it, I do
not necessarily like to take in my coffee as a substitute
for sugar, on my bread as a substitute for butter, and in
my ear as a substitute for pleasant general conversation.</p>

<p>I do not wish to seem to speak disparagingly of
women of this type, for they are doing good, and they
will do more good when they have become more accustomed
to possessing minds. Having but recently discovered
their minds, they are playing with them enthusiastically,
like children who have just discovered their
new toys on Christmas morning. It is delightful to
watch them. It is diverting to have them pop ideas at
you with that bright-eyed, efficient, assertive look which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
seems to say: "See! I am a liberal woman&mdash;a woman
of the new type. I meet men on their own ground. Do
you wish to talk of birth control, social hygiene, and sex
attraction? Or shall we reverse the order? Or shall I
show you how much I know about Brieux, and household
economics, and Ellen Key, and eugenics, and George
Meredith, and post-impressionism, and "Roberts' Rules
of Order," and theosophy, and conditions in the Sixteenth
Ward?"</p>

<p>When one thinks of these city groups, and of mail-order
houses, and Fords, one may begin to fear it is
indeed true that we are becoming standardized, but
when one lets one's mind drift over the country as
the eye drifts over a map; when one thinks of the
quantities of modest, thoughtful, gentle, generous, intelligent,
sound American families which are to be found
in every city and every town, and thinks again, in a
twinkling, of sheriffs and mining-camp policemen in
the Far West, of boys going to Harvard, and other
boys going to the University of Kansas, others to the
old Southern universities, so rich in tradition, and still
others to Annapolis or West Point; when one thinks of
the snow glittering on the Rocky Mountain wall, back of
Denver; of sleepy little towns drowsing in the sun beside
the Mississippi; of Charles W. Eliot of Cambridge, and
Hy Gill of Seattle; of Dr. Lyman Abbott of New York
and Tom Watson of Georgia; of General Leonard Wood
and Colonel William Jennings Bryan; of ex-slaves living
in their cabins behind Virginia manor houses, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Filipino and Kanaka fishermen living in villages built
on stilts beside the bayous below New Orleans; of the
dry salt desert of Utah, and two great rivers meeting
between green rocky hills, at Harper's Ferry; of men
working in offices at the top of the Woolworth Building
in New York, and other men working thousands of feet
below the ground, in the copper mines of Butte and the
iron and coal mines of Birmingham&mdash;when one thinks
of these things one quickly ceases to fear that the United
States is standardized, and instead begins to fear that
few Americans will ever know the varied wonder of
their country, and the varied character of its inhabitants,
their problems, hopes, and views.</p>

<p>If I lived somewhere in the region of Boston, New
York, or Philadelphia and wished quickly to learn
whether the country were really standardized or not, I
should get into my automobile&mdash;or into some one else's&mdash;and
take an autumn tour through Baltimore, past
Doughoregan Manor, some miles to the west of Baltimore,
on to Frederick, Maryland (where they dispute,
quite justly, I believe, the truth of the Barbara Frietchie
legend), and thence "over the mountain wall" and down
into the northeastern corner of the most irregularly
shaped State in the Union, West Virginia. I should
strike for Harper's Ferry, and from there run to
Charles Town, a few miles distant (where John Brown
was tried and executed for the Harper's Ferry raid),
and after circulating about that corner of the State, I
should go down into Virginia by the good highway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
which leads from Charles Town to Berryville&mdash;"Bur'v'l,"
they pronounce it&mdash;and to "Winchester twenty
miles away" (where they say that Sheridan's Ride was
nothing to make such a lot of talk about!), and then
back, by way of Berryville, and over the Blue Ridge
Mountains into the great fox-hunting counties of Virginia:
Clark, Loudon, and Fauquier. Here I should
see a hunt meet or a race meet. There are many other
places to which I might go after that, but as I meant only
to suggest an easy little tour, I shall stop at this point,
contenting myself with saying that not far to the south
is Charlottesville, where Jefferson built that most beautiful
of all universities, the University of Virginia, and
his wonderful house Monticello; that Staunton (pronounced
as without the "u"), where Woodrow Wilson
was born, lies west of Charlottesville, while Fredericksburg,
where Washington's mother lived, lies to the
northeast.</p>

<p>Some such trip as this I should take instead of a conventional
New England tour. And before starting I
should buy a copy of Louise Closser Hale's delightful
book, "Into the Old Dominion."</p>

<p>One beauty of the trip that I suggest is that it isn't all
the same. In one place you get a fair country hotel,
in another an inn, and somewhere along the way you
may have to spend a night in a private house. Also,
though the roads through Maryland, and the part of
West Virginia I speak of, are generally good, my experience
of Virginia roads, especially through the moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>tains,
leads me to conclude that in respect to highways
Virginia remains a backward State. But who
wants to ride always over oiled roads, always to hotels
with marble lobbies, or big white porches full of hungry-eyed
young women, and old ladies, knitting? Only the
standardized tourist. And I am not addressing him.</p>

<p>I am talking to the motorist who is not ossified in
habit, who has a love of strangeness and the picturesque&mdash;not
only in scenery but in houses and people and
the kind of life those people lead. For it is quite true
that, as Professor Roland C. Usher said in his "Pan
Americanism," "the information in New York about
Buenos Aires is more extended, accurate, and contemporaneous
than the notions in Maine about Alabama....
Isolation is more a matter of time than of
space, and common interests are due to the ease of transportation
and communication more often than geographical
location."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Three States meet at Harper's Ferry, and the
line dividing two of them is indicated where it
crosses the station platform. If you alight at
the rear end of the train, you are in Maryland; at the
front, you are in West Virginia. This I like. I have
always liked important but invisible boundaries&mdash;boundaries
of states or, better yet, of countries. When
I cross them I am disposed to step high, as though not
to trip upon them, and then to pause with one foot in
one land and one in another, trying to imagine that I
feel the division running through my body.</p>

<p>Harper's Ferry is an entrancing old town; a drowsy
place, piled up beautifully, yet carelessly, upon terraced
roads clinging to steep hills, which slope on one
side to the Potomac, on the other to the Shenandoah,
and come to a point, like the prow of a great ship, at the
confluence of the two.</p>

<span class="caption">Harpers Ferry is an entrancing old town; a drowsy place piled up beautifully yet carelessly upon terraced roads
clinging to steep hillsides</span>
</div>

<p>There is something foreign in the appearance of the
place. Many times, as I looked at old stone houses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a story or two high on one side, three or four stories on
the other, seeming to set their claws into the cliffs and
cling there for dear life, I thought of houses in Capri
and Amalfi, and in some towns in France; and again
there were low cottages built of blocks of shale covered
with a thin veneer of white plaster showing the outlines
of the stones beneath, which, squatting down amid their
trees and flowers, resembled peasant cottages in Normandy
or Brittany, or in Ireland.</p>

<p>It is a town in which to ramble for an hour, uphill,
down and around; stopping now to delight in a crumbling
stone wall, tied together with Kenilworth ivy;
now to watch a woman making apple butter in a
great iron pot; now to see an old negro clamber slowly
into his rickety wagon, take up the rope reins, and start
his skinny horse with the surprising words: "Come
hither!"; now to look at an old tangled garden, terraced
rudely up a hillside; now to read the sign, on a telegraph
pole in the village, bearing the frank threat: "If you
Hitch your Horses Here they will be Turned Loose."
Now you will come upon a terraced road, at one side of
which stands an old house draped over the rocks in such
a way as to provide entrance from the ground level, on
any one of three stories; or an unexpected view down a
steep roadway, or over ancient moss-grown housetops
to where, as an old book I found there puts it, "between
two ramparts, in a gorge of savage grandeur, the lordly
Potomac takes to his embrace the beautiful Shenandoah."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The liaison between the rivers, described in this
Rabelaisian manner by the author of "The Annals of
Harper's Ferry," has been going on for a long time with
all the brazen publicity of a love scene on a park bench.
I recommend the matter to the attention of the Society
for the Suppression of Vice, which once took action
to prohibit a novel by Mr. Theodore Dreiser. A great
many people wish to read Mr. Dreiser's books yet no one
has to read them if he does not want to. But it is a
different matter with these rivers. Sensitive citizens of
Harper's Ferry and pure-minded passengers on the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad are obliged daily to witness
what is going on.</p>

<p>Before the days of the Society for the Suppression of
Vice, and of the late Anthony Comstock, when we had
no one to make it clear to us exactly what was shocking,
little was thought of the public scandal between
the Potomac and the Shenandoah. Thomas Jefferson
seems to have rather liked it; there is a point above the
town, known as Jefferson's Rock, at which, it is said,
the author of the Declaration of Independence stood
and uttered a sentiment about the spectacle. Everybody
in Harper's Ferry agrees that Jefferson stood at
Jefferson's Rock and said something appropriate, and
any one of them will try to tell you what he said, but
each version will be different.</p>

<p>A young lady told me that he said: "This view is
worth a trip across the Atlantic Ocean."</p>

<p>A young man in a blue felt hat of the fried-egg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
variety said that Jefferson declared, with his well-known
simplicity: "This is the grandest view I ever seen."</p>

<p>An old man who had to go through the tobacco
chewer's pre-conversational rite before replying to my
question gave it as: "Pfst!&mdash;They ain't nothin' in
Europe ner Switzerland ner nowheres else, I reckon', to
beat this-here scenery."</p>

<p>The man at the drug store quoted differently alleging
the saying to have been: "Europe has nothing on this":
whereas the livery stable man's version was: "This has
that famous German river&mdash;the Rhine River don't they
call it?&mdash;skinned to death."</p>

<p>Whatever Jefferson's remark was, there has been
added to the spectacle at Harper's Ferry, since his day,
a new feature, which, could he have but seen it, must
have struck him forcibly, and might perhaps have
caused him to say more.</p>

<p>At a lofty point upon the steep wall of Maryland
Heights, across the Potomac from the town, far, far
up upon the side of the cliff, commanding a view not only
of both rivers, but of their meeting place and their joint
course below, and of the lovely contours of the Blue
Ridge Mountains, fading to smoky coloring in the remote
distance, there has, of late years, appeared the outline
of a gigantic face, which looks out from its emplacement
like some Teutonic god in vast effigy, its huge
luxuriant mustaches pointing East and West as though
in symbolism of the conquest of a continent. A blue
and yellow background, tempered somewhat by the ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ments,
serves to attract attention to the face and to the
legend which accompanies it, but the thing one sees
above all else, the thing one recognizes, is the face itself,
with its look half tragic, half resigned, yet always
so inscrutable: for it is none other than the beautiful
brooding countenance of Gerhard Mennen, the talcum-powder
gentleman.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The great story of Harper's Ferry is of course the
John Brown story. Joseph I.&nbsp;C. Clarke, writing in the
New York "Sun" of Sir Roger Casement's execution
for treason in connection with the Irish rebellion, compared
him with John Brown and also with Don Quixote.
The spiritual likeness between these three bearded figures
is striking enough. All were idealists; all were
fanatics. Brown's ideal was a noble one&mdash;that of freedom&mdash;but
his manner of attempting to translate it into
actuality was that of a madman. He believed not only
that the slaves should be freed, but that the blood of
slaveholders should be shed in atonement. In "bleeding
Kansas" he led the Ossawatomie massacre, and
committed cold-blooded murders under the delusion that
the sword of the Lord was in his hand.</p>

<p>In October, 1859, Brown, who had for some time been
living under an assumed name in the neighborhood of
Harper's Ferry, led a score of his followers, some of
them negroes, in a surprise attack upon the Government
arsenal at this place, capturing the watchmen and taking
possession of the buildings. It was his idea to get the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
weapons the arsenal contained and give them to the
slaves that they might rise and free themselves. Before
this plan could be executed, however, Brown and his
men were besieged in the armory, and here, after a day
or two of bloody fighting, with a number of deaths on
both sides, he was captured with his few surviving men,
by Colonel (later General) Robert E. Lee, whose aide,
upon this occasion, was J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart, later the Confederate
cavalry leader. Stuart had been in Kansas,
and it was he who recognized the leader of the raid as
Brown of Ossawatomie.</p>

<p>It is said that Brown's violent anti-slavery feeling was
engendered by his having seen, in his youth, a colored
boy of about his own age cruelly misused. He brooded
over the wrongs of the blacks until, as some students of
his life believe, he became insane on this subject. His
utterances show that he was willing to give up his life
and those of his sons and other followers, if by such
action he could merely draw attention to the cause which
had taken possession of his soul. In the course of the
fighting he saw his two sons mortally wounded, and was
himself stabbed and cut. Throughout the fight and his
subsequent trial at Charles Town he remained imperturbable;
when taken to the gallows he sat upon his
coffin, in a wagon, and he not only mounted the scaffold
without a tremor, but actually stood there, apparently
unmoved, for ten or fifteen minutes, with the noose
around his neck, while the troops which had formed his
escort were marched to their positions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>A large number of troops were present at the execution,
for it was then believed in the South that the Brown
raid was not the mere suicidal stroke of an individual
fanatic, but an organized movement on the part of the
Republican party; an effort to rescue Brown was therefore
apprehended. This idea was later shown to be a
fallacy, Brown having made his own plans, and been
financed by a few northern friends, headed by Gerrit
Smith of New York.</p>

<p>There has been a tendency in the North to make a
saint of John Brown, and in the South to make a devil
of him. As a matter of fact he was a poor, misguided
zealot, with a wild light in his eye, who had set out to
do a frightful thing; for, bad though slavery was, its
evils were not comparable with the horrors which would
have resulted from a slave rebellion.</p>

<p>It must be conceded, however, that those who would
canonize John Brown have upon their side a strange and
impressive piece of evidence. The jail where he was
lodged in Charles Town and the courthouse where he
was tried, still stand, and it is the actual fact that, when
the snow falls, it always miraculously melts in a path
which leads diagonally across the street from the one to
the other. That this is true I have unimpeachable testimony.
<i>Snow will not stand on the path by which
John Brown crossed back and forth from the jail to the
court-house.</i> There will be snow over all the rest of
the street, but not on that path; there you can see it
melting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as with certain other "miracles," this one is not
so difficult to understand if you know how it is brought
about. The courthouse is heated from the jail, and the
hot pipes run under the pavement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<br />
THE VIRGINIAS AND THE WASHINGTONS</h2>


<p>In colonial times, and long thereafter, the present
State of West Virginia was a part of Virginia.
Virginia, in the old days, used to have no western
borders to her most westerly counties, which, in theory,
ran out to infinity. As the western part of the State
became settled, county lines were drawn, and new
counties were started farther back from the coast. For
this reason, towns which are now in Jefferson County,
West Virginia, used to be in that county of Virginia
which lies to the east of Jefferson County, and some
towns have been in several different counties in the
course of their history.</p>

<p>The people in the eastern part of West Virginia are,
so far as I am capable of judging, precisely like Virginians.
The old houses, when built, were in Virginia,
the names of the people are Virginian names, and customs
and points of view are Virginian. Until I went
there I was not aware how very much this means.</p>

<p>I do not know who wrote the school history I studied
as a boy, but I do know now that it was written by a lopsided
historian, and that his "lop," like that of many
another of his kind, led him to enlarge upon American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
naval and military victories, to minimize American defeats,
to give an impression that the all-important early
colonies were those of New England, and that the all-important
one of them was Massachusetts. From this
bias I judge that the historian was a Boston man. It
takes a Bostonian to think in that way. They do it still.</p>

<p>From my school history I gathered the idea that although
Sir Walter Raleigh and Captain John Smith
were so foolish as to dally more or less in the remote
fastnesses of Virginia, and although there was a little
ineffectual settlement at Jamestown, all the important
colonizing of this country occurred in New England. I
read about Peregrine White, but not about Virginia
Dare; I read much of Miles Standish, but nothing of
Christopher Newport; I read a great deal of the <i>Mayflower</i>,
but not a word of the <i>Susan Constant</i>.</p>

<p>Yet Virginia Dare, if she lived, must have been nearing
young ladyhood when Peregrine White was born;
Captain Christopher Newport passed the Virginia
capes when Miles Standish was hardly more than a
youth, in Lancashire; and the <i>Susan Constant</i> landed
the Jamestown settlers more than a dozen years before
the <i>Mayflower</i> landed her shipload of eminent furniture
owners at Plymouth. Even Plymouth itself had
been visited years before by John Smith, and it was he,
not the Pilgrims, who named the place.</p>

<p>I find that some boys, to-day, know these things.
But though that fact is encouraging, I am not writing
for boys, but for their comparatively ignorant parents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only did the first English colony establish itself
in Virginia, and the first known tobacco come from there&mdash;a
point the importance of which cannot be overstated&mdash;but
the history of the Old Dominion is in every way
more romantic and heroic than that of any other State.
The first popular government existed there long before
the Revolution, and at the time of the break with the
mother country Virginia was the most wealthy and
populous of the Colonies. Some historians say that
slavery was first introduced there when some Dutchmen
sold to the colonists a shipload of negroes, but I
believe this point is disputed. The Declaration of Independence
was, of course, written by a Virginian, and
made good by the sword of one. The first President of
the United States was a Virginian, and so is the present
Chief Executive. The whole of New England has produced
but four presidents; Ohio has produced six; but
Virginia has given us eight. The first British army to
land on this continent (Braddock's) landed in Virginia,
and in that State our two greatest wars were terminated
by the surrenders of Cornwallis and of Lee. And, last,
the gallant Lee himself was a Virginian of the Virginians&mdash;a
son of the distinguished Henry Lee who said
of Washington that he was "first in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen."</p>

<p>On the pleasant drive of perhaps a dozen miles, from
Harper's Ferry to Charles Town, I noticed here and
there, at the roadside, pyramidal stones, suggesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
monuments, but bearing no inscription save that each
had a number. On inquiry I learned that these were
indeed Confederate monuments, but that to find out
what they marked it was necessary to go to the county
courthouse at Charles Town and look up the numbers
in a book, of which there is but one copy. These monuments
were set out three or four years ago. They appeared
suddenly, almost as though they had grown overnight,
and many people wondered, as I had, what they
meant.</p>

<p>"Eloise," one Charles Town young lady asked another,
"what's that monument out in front of your
house with the number twenty-one on it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Eloise, "that's where all my suitors are
buried."</p>

<p>One of the things which gives Jefferson County, West
Virginia, its Virginian flavor is the collection of fine
old houses which adorn it. Many of these houses are
the homes of families bearing the name of Washington,
or having in their veins the blood of the Washingtons.
It is said that there is more Washington blood in
Charles Town (which, by the way, should not be confused
with Charleston, capital of the same State), than
in any other place, if not in all the rest of the world
together. The nearest competitors to Charles Town in
this respect are Westmoreland County, Virginia, and
the town of Kankakee, Illinois, where resides the
Spottswood Augustine Washington family, said to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the only Washington group to have taken the Union
side in the Civil War. It is rumored also that all the
Washingtons are Democrats, although that fact is hard
to reconcile, at the present time, with the statement that,
among the five thousand of them, there is but a single
Federal officeholder.</p>

<p>The settling of the Washingtons in Jefferson County,
West Virginia, came about through the fact that George
Washington, when a youth of sixteen or seventeen, became
acquainted with that part of what was then Virginia,
through having gone to survey for Lord Fairfax,
who had acquired an enormous tract of land in the
neighboring county of Clarke, which is still in the
mother State. To this estate, called Greenaway Court,
his lordship, it is recorded, came from England to isolate
himself because a woman with whom he was in love
refused to marry him.</p>

<p>In this general neighborhood George Washington
lived for three years, and local enthusiasts affirm that to
his having drunk the lime-impregnated waters of this
valley was due his great stature. The man who informed
me of this theory had lived there aways. He
was about five feet three inches tall, and had drunk the
waters all his life&mdash;plain and otherwise.</p>

<p>Washington's accounts of the region so interested his
brothers that they finally moved there, acquired large
tracts of land, and built homes. Charles Town, indeed,
was laid out on the land of Charles Washington, and
was named for him, and there is evidence that George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Washington, who certainly gave the lines for the roads
about the place, also laid out the town.</p>

<p>Another brother, John Augustine, left a large family,
while Samuel, the oldest, described as "a rollicking country
squire," was several years short of fifty when he
died, but for all that had managed to marry five times
and to find, nevertheless, spare moments in which to lay
out the historic estate of Harewood, not far from
Charles Town. It is said that George Washington was
his brother's partner in this enterprise, but excepting
in its interior, which is very beautiful, there is no
sign, about the building, of his graceful architectural
touch.</p>

<p>George Washington spent much time at Harewood,
Lafayette and his son visited there, and there the
sprightly widow, Dolly Todd, married James Madison.
This wedding was attended by President Washington
and his wife and by many other national figures; the
bride made the journey to Harewood in Jefferson's
coach, escorted by Madison and a group of his friends
on horseback, and history makes mention of a very large
and very gay company.</p>

<p>This is all very well until you see Harewood; for, substantial
though the house is, with its two-foot stone
walls, it has but five rooms: two downstairs and three
up.</p>

<p>Where did they all sleep?</p>

<p>The question was put by the practical young lady
whom I accompanied to Harewood, but the wife of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
farmer to whom the place is rented could only smile and
shake her head.</p>

<p>The bedroom now occupied by this farmer and his
wife has doubtless been occupied also by the first President
of the United States and his wife, the fourth President
and his wife, by Lafayette, and by a King of France&mdash;for
Louis-Philippe, and his brothers, the Duc de
Montpensier and the Comte de Beaujolais, spent some
time at Harewood during their period of exile.</p>

<p>Having read in an extract from the Baltimore "Sun"
that Harewood, which is still owned in the Washington
family, was a place in which all Washingtons took great
and proper pride, that it was "the lodestone which draws
the wandering Washingtons back to the old haunts,"
I was greatly shocked on visiting the house to see the
shameful state of dilapidation into which it has been allowed
to pass. The porches and steps have fallen down,
the garden is a disreputable tangle, and the graves in
the yard are heaped with tumble-down stones about
which the cattle graze. The only parts of the building
in good repair are those parts which time has not yet
succeeded in destroying. The drawing-room, containing
a mantelpiece given to Washington by Lafayette,
and the finest wood paneling I have seen in any American
house, has held its own fairly well, as has also
the old stairway, imported by Washington from England.
But that these things are not in ruins, like the
porches, is no credit to the Washingtons who own the
property to-day, and who, having rented the place, actu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>ally
leave family portraits hanging on the walls to crack
and rot through the cold winter.</p>

<p>If there are indeed five thousand Washingtons, and if
they are proud of their descent, a good way for them to
show it would be to contribute twenty-five cents each to be
expended on putting Harewood in respectable condition.</p>

<p>The last member of the Washington family to own
Mount Vernon was John Augustine Washington, of
Charles Town, who sold the former home of his distinguished
collateral ancestor. This Mr. Washington was
a Confederate officer in the Civil War. He had a son
named George, whose widow, if I mistake not, is the
Mrs. George Washington of Charles Town, of whom I
heard an amusing story.</p>

<p>With another Charles Town lady this Mrs. Washington
went to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and
the two attended the Fair together on Washington Day.
On this occasion Mrs. Washington made a purchase in
one of the buildings, and ordered it sent to her home in
Charles Town.</p>

<p>"What name?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"Mrs. George Washington."</p>

<p>The clerk concluded that she was joking.</p>

<p>"I want your <i>real</i> name," he insisted with a smile.</p>

<p>"But," plaintively protested the gentle Mrs. Washington,
"that is the only name I <i>have</i>!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One of the most charming of the old houses in the
neighborhood of Charles Town, and one of the few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
which is still occupied by the descendants of its builder,
is Piedmont, the residence of the Briscoe family. It is
a brick house, nearly a century and a half old, with a
lovely old portico, and it contains two of the most interesting
relics I saw on my entire journey in the South.
The first of these is the wall paper of the drawing-room,
upon which is depicted, not in pattern, but in a series
of pictures with landscape backgrounds, various scenes
representing the adventures of Telemachus on his search
for his father. I remember having seen on the walls
of the parlor of an old hotel at South Berwick, Maine,
some early wall paper of this character, but the pictures
on that paper were done in various shades of gray,
whereas the Piedmont wall paper is in many colors.
The other relic is a letter which Mrs. Briscoe drew from
her desk quite as though it had been a note received that
morning from a friend. It was written on tough buff-colored
paper, and, though the ink was brown with age,
the handwriting was clear and legible and the paper
was not broken at the folds. It was dated "Odiham,
Sept. 1st, 1633," and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">To Dr. John Briscoe</span>, <i>Greetings</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: As the Privy Council have decided that I shall
not be disturbed or dispossessed of the charter granted by his
Majesty&mdash;the <i>Ark</i> and Pinnace <i>Dove</i> will sail from Gravesend
about the 1st of October, and if you are of the same mind as
when I conversed with you, I would be glad to have you join
the colony.</p>

<p>With high esteem, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient servant,</p>
<p><span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 12em;">Cecilius Baltimore.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter from the second Lord Baltimore refers
to the historic voyage which resulted in the first settlement
of Maryland, thirteen years after the landing of
the Pilgrims at Plymouth. As for Dr. Briscoe, to
whom the letter was written, he was one of the three
hundred original colonists, but after settling in St.
Mary's, near the mouth of the Potomac, removed to the
place where his descendants still reside.</p>

<p>Farther out in Jefferson County the motorist may
pass through two curious hamlets which, though not
many miles from Charles Town, have the air of being
completely removed from the world. One of these was
known, many years ago, as Middleway, and later as
Smithfield, but is now called Clip&mdash;and for a curious
reason.</p>

<p>When the stagecoaches were running, the town was
quite a place, as its several good old houses indicate;
but the railroads, when they were built, ignored the
town, but killed the stage lines, with the result that the
little settlement dried up. Even before this an old plaster-covered
house, still standing, became haunted. The
witches who resided in it developed the unpleasant custom
of flying out at night and cutting pieces from the
clothing of passers-by. And that is how the town came
to be called Clip.</p>

<p>A century or so ago, when the rudeness of the witches
had long annoyed the inhabitants of Clip, and had
proved very detrimental to their clothing, a Roman
Catholic priest came along and told them that if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
would give him a certain field, he would rid them of
the evil spirits. This struck the worthy citizens of
Clip as a good bargain; they gave the priest his field
(it is still known as the Priest's Field, and is now used
as a place for basket picnics) and forthwith the operations
of the witches ceased. So, at least, the story
goes.</p>

<p>Not far beyond Clip lies the hamlet of Leetown, taking
its name from that General Charles Lee who commanded
an American army in the Revolutionary War,
but who was suspected by Washington of being a traitor,
and was finally court-martialed and cashiered from
the army. The old stone house which Lee built at Leetown,
and in which he lived after his disgrace, still remains.
Instead of having partitions in his house the
old general lived in one large room, upon the floor of
which he made chalk marks to indicate different chambers.
Here he dwelt surrounded by innumerable dogs,
and here he was frequently visited by Generals Horatio
Gates and Adam Stephen, who were neighbors and
cronies of his, and met at his house to drink wine and
exchange stories.</p>

<p>It is said that upon one of these occasions Lee got up
and declared:</p>

<p>"The county of Berkeley is to be congratulated upon
having as citizens three noted generals of the Revolution,
each of whom was ignominiously cashiered. You,
Stephen, for getting drunk when you should have been
sober; you, Gates, for advancing when you should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
retreated; and your humble servant for retreating when
he should have advanced."</p>

<p>Lee was a turbulent, insubordinate, hard-drinking
rascal, and nothing could be more characteristic than the
will, written in his own handwriting, filed by the old
reprobate with the clerk of the Berkeley County Court,
and expressing the following sentiments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I desire most earnestly that I may not be buried in any church
or churchyard, or within a mile of any Presbyterian or Anabaptist
meeting house, for since I have resided in this county I
have kept so much bad company when living that I do not desire
to continue it when dead.</p></div>

<p>During Lee's life there, Leetown was probably a livelier
place than it is to-day. Something of its present
state may be gathered from the fact that when a lady
of my acquaintance stopped her motor there recently,
and asked some men what time it was, they stared
blankly at her for a moment, after which one of them
said seriously:</p>

<p>"We don't know. We don't have time here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Claymont Court, near Charles Town, the
house in which my companion and I were so
fortunate as to be guests during our visit to
this part of the country, is one of the old Washington
houses, having been built by Bushrod Corbin Washington,
a nephew of the first President. It is a beautiful
brick building, with courts at either end, the brick walls
of which, connecting with the house, extend its lines
with peculiar grace, and tie to the main structure the
twin buildings which balance it, according to the delightful
fashion of early Virginia architecture. The
hexagonal brick tile of the front walk at Claymont
Court, and the square stone pavement of the portico,
resemble exactly those at Mount Vernon, and are said
to have been imported at the same time; and it is believed
also that the Claymont box trees were brought over with
those growing at Mount Vernon.</p>

<span class="caption">Claymont Court is one of the old Washington houses. But in all its history it has never been a happier home or a

</div>

<p>The estate was sold out of the Washington family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
in 1870, when it was acquired by a Colonel March, who
later sold it to a gentleman whose wild performances
at Claymont are not only remembered, but are commemorated
in the house. In the cellar, for instance,
bricked up in a room barely large enough to hold it,
whence it cannot be removed except by tearing down a
heavy wall, stands a huge carved sideboard to which
the young man took a dislike, and which he therefore
caused to be carried to the cellar and immured, despite
the protests of his family. It is said that upon another
occasion he conceived the picturesque idea of riding his
horse upstairs and hitching it to his bedpost; and that
he did so is witnessed by definite marks of horseshoes
on the oak treads of the stair. Later Frank R. Stockton
purchased the place, and there he wrote his story
"The Captain of the Toll-Gate," which was published
posthumously.</p>

<p>But in all its history this glorious old house has never
been a happier home, or a more interesting one, than it
is to-day. For now it is the residence of four young
ladies, sisters, who, because of their divergent tastes
and their complete congeniality, continually suggest the
fancy that they have stepped out of a novel. One of
them is the Efficient Sister, who runs the automobile
and the farm of two or three hundred acres, sells the
produce, keeps the accounts, and pays off the men; another
is the Domestic Sister, who conducts the admirable
m&eacute;nage; another is the Sociological and Artistic
Sister, who draws and plays and thinks about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
masses; while the fourth is the Sprightly Sister Who
Likes to Dance.</p>

<p>Never had my companion or I seen a more charming,
a more varied household, an establishment more
self-contained, more complete in all things from vegetables
to brains. No need to leave the place for anything.
Yet if one wished to look about the country,
there was the motor, and there were the saddle horses
in the stable&mdash;all of them members of old Virginian
families&mdash;and there were four equestrian young ladies.</p>

<p>"Would you-all like to ride to-day?" one of the sisters
asked us at breakfast.</p>

<p>To my companion, horseback riding is comparatively
a new thing. He had taken it up a year before&mdash;partly
because of appeals from me, partly because of changes
which he had begun to notice in his topography. Compared
with him I was a veteran horseman, for it was
then a year and three months since I had begun my riding
lessons.</p>

<p>I said that I would like to ride, but he declared that he
must stay behind and make a drawing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the past, I had thought I would prefer
to make my living as a painter or an illustrator than
as a writer, but at this juncture it occurred to me that,
though the writer's medium of expression is a less
agreeable one than that of the graphic artist, it is much
pleasanter to ride about with pretty girls than to sit
alone and draw a picture of their house. I began to
feel sorry for my companion: the thought of our rid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ing
gaily off, and leaving him at work, made him seem
pathetic. My appeals, however, made no impression
upon his inflexible sense of duty, and I soon ceased trying
to persuade him to join us, and began to speculate,
instead, as to whether all four sisters would accompany
me, or whether only two or three of them would go&mdash;and
if so, which.</p>

<p>"What kind of horse do you like?" asked one.</p>

<p>Such a question always troubles me. It is embarrassing.
Imagine saying to a young lady who likes to
ride thoroughbred hunters across fields and over ditches
and fences: "I should like a handsome horse, one that
will cause me to appear to advantage, one that looks
spirited but is in reality tame."</p>

<p>Such an admission would be out of character with the
whole idea of riding. One could hardly make it to one's
most intimate male friend, let alone to a girl who knows
all about withers and hocks and pastern joints, and
talks about "paneled country," and takes the "Racing
Calendar."</p>

<p>To such a young lady it is impossible to say: "I
have ridden for a little more than a year; the horses
with which I am acquainted are benevolent creatures
from a riding school near Central Park; they go around
the reservoir twice, and return automatically, and they
sigh deeply when one mounts and again when one gets
off."</p>

<p>No; that sort of thing will not do at all; for the horse&mdash;besides
having been placed in a position more aristo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>cratic
than ever, through the philanthropies of Henry
Ford&mdash;is essentially "sporty." You must be a "sport"
or you must keep away from him. You must approach
him with dash or you must not approach him at all.
And when a young lady inquires what kind of horse you
like, there is but one way to reply.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter at all," I answered. "Any horse
will do for me." Then, after a little pause, I added, as
though it were merely an amusing afterthought: "I
suppose I shall be stiff after my ride. I haven't been on
a horse in nearly two months."</p>

<p>"Then," said the sympathetic young lady, "you'll
want an easy ride."</p>

<p>"I suppose it <i>might</i> be more sensible," I conceded.</p>

<p>"Better give him the black mare," put in the Efficient
Sister.</p>

<p>"She hasn't been out lately," said the other. "You
know how she acts when she hasn't been ridden enough.
He might not know just how to take her. I was thinking
of giving him 'Dr. Bell.'"</p>

<p>"Dr. Bell's too gentle," said the Efficient Sister.</p>

<p>"Which horse do you think you'd like?" the other
asked me. "Dr. Bell has plenty of life, but he's gentle.
The black mare's a little bit flighty at first, but if
you can ride her she soon finds it out and settles down."</p>

<p>I want to ask: "What happens if she finds out that
you <i>can't</i> ride her? What does she do then?" But I
refrained.</p>

<p>"She's never thrown anybody but a stable boy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a man who came up here to visit&mdash;and neither one of
them could ride worth a cent," said the Efficient Sister.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had been thinking hard.</p>

<p>"What color is Dr. Bell?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He's a sorrel."</p>

<p>"Then," I said, "I believe I'd rather ride Dr. Bell.
I don't like black horses. It is simply one of those peculiar
aversions one gets."</p>

<p>They seemed to accept this statement, and so the matter
was agreeably settled.</p>

<p>When, at ten o'clock, I came down dressed for riding,
my companion was out in front of the house, making
a drawing; the four young ladies were with him, all
seemingly enchanted with his work, and none of them in
riding habits.</p>

<span class="caption">When I came down, dressed for riding, my companion was making a drawing; the four young ladies were with him,

</div>

<p>"Who's going with me?" I asked as I strolled toward
them.</p>

<p>They looked at one another inquiringly. Then the
Efficient Sister said: "I'd like to go, but this is pay
day and I can't leave the place."</p>

<p>"I have to go to town for some supplies," said the
Domestic Sister.</p>

<p>"I want to stay and watch this," said the Sociological
and Artistic Sister. (She made a gesture toward
my companion, but I think she referred to his drawing.)</p>

<p>"I'm going away to a house party," said the Sprightly
Sister who Likes to Dance. "I must pack."</p>

<p>"You can't get lost," said the Domestic Sister.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even if you should," put in the Efficient Sister, "Dr.
Bell would bring you home."</p>

<p>During this conversation my companion did not look
up from his work, neither did he speak; yet upon his
back there was an expression of derisive glee which
made me hope, vindictively, that he would smudge his
drawing. However inscrutable his face, I have never
known a man with a back so expressive.</p>

<p>"Here comes Dr. Bell," remarked the Sociological
and Artistic Sister, as a negro groom appeared leading
the sorrel steed.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, trying to speak debonairely as I
started toward the drive, "I'll be going."</p>

<p>I wished to leave them where they were and go
around to the other side of the house to mount. I had
noticed a stone block there and meant to use it if no one
but the groom were present; also I intended to tip the
groom and ask him a few casual questions about the
ways of Dr. Bell.</p>

<p>I might have managed this but for a sudden manifestation
of interest on the part of my companion.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said to the young ladies, "let's go
and see him off." It seemed to me that he emphasized
the word "off" unpleasantly. However I tried to seem
calm as we moved toward the drive.</p>

<p>Dr. Bell had a bright brown eye; there was something
alert in the gaze with which he watched us moving
toward him. However, to my great relief he stood
quite still while two of the sisters who preceded me by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a few steps, went up and patted him. Evidently he liked
to be patted. I decided that I would pat him also.</p>

<p>I had approached him from the left and in order to
mount I now found it necessary to circle around, in
front of him. I was determined that if the horse would
but remain stationary I should step up to him, speak to
him, give him a quick pat on the neck, gather the reins
in my hand, place my foot swiftly in the stirrup, take
a good hop, and be on his back before any one had time
to notice.</p>

<p>Dr. Bell, however, caused me to alter these plans;
for though he had stood docile as a dog while the sisters
patted him, his manner underwent a change on sight
of me. I do not think this change was caused by any
personal dislike for me. I believe he would have done
the same had any stranger appeared before him in riding
boots. The trouble was, probably, that he had expected
to be ridden by one of the young ladies, and was
shocked by the abrupt discovery that a total stranger
was to ride him. This is merely my surmise. I do not
claim deep understanding of the mental workings of
any horse, for there is no logic about them or their
performances. They are like crafty lunatics, reasoning,
if they reason at all, in a manner too treacherous
and devious for human comprehension. Their very
usefulness, the service they render man, is founded on
their own folly; were it not for that, man could not even
catch them, let alone force them to submit, like weak-minded
giants, to his will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is that, excepting barnyard fowls, the horse
is the most idiotic of all animals, and, pound for pound,
even the miserable hen is his intellectual superior. Indeed,
if horses had brains no better than those of hens,
but proportionately larger, they would not be drawing
wagons, and carrying men upon their backs, but would
be lecturing to women's clubs, and holding chairs in universities,
and writing essays on the Development of the
Short Story in America.</p>

<p>Horse lovers, who are among the most prejudiced of
all prejudiced people, and who regard horses with an
amiable but fatuous admiration such as young parents
have for their babies, will try to tell you that these
great creatures which they love are not mentally deficient.
Ask them why the horse, with his superior
strength, submits to man, and they will tell you that the
horse's eye magnifies, and that, to the horse, man consequently
appears to be two or three times his actual
size.</p>

<p>Nonsense! There is but one reason for the yielding
of the horse: he is an utter fool.</p>

<p>Everything proves him a fool. He will charge into
battle, he will walk cheerfully beside a precipice, he
will break his back pulling a heavy wagon, or break
his leg or his neck in jumping a hurdle; yet he will go
into a frenzy of fright at the sight of a running child,
a roadside rock, or the shadow of a branch across the
path, and not even a German chancellor could shy as he
will at a scrap of paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>As I passed in front of Dr. Bell he rolled his eyes at
me horribly, and rose upon his hind legs, almost upsetting
the groom as he went up and barely missing him
with his fore feet as he brought them to earth again.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" I asked, stopping.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;What&#39;s the matter with him?&quot; I asked, stopping</span>
</div>

<p>"I guess he just feels good," said the Efficient Sister.</p>

<p>"Yassuh, tha 's all," said the groom cheerfully.
"<i>He's</i> aw' right. Gentle ath a lamb."</p>

<p>As he made this statement, I took another step in the
direction of the horse, whereat he reared again.</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>, now!" said the groom, patting Dr. Bell upon
the neck. "Feelin' pretty good 's mawnin', is you?
There, there!"</p>

<p>Dr. Bell, however, paid little attention to his attendant,
but gazed steadily at me with an evil look.</p>

<p>"Does he always do like that?" I asked the Domestic
Sister.</p>

<p>"I never saw him do it before," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe he doesn't admire the cut of your riding
breeches," suggested my companion.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, suh," protested the groom. "It 's jes' his
li'l way tryin' t' tell you he likes de ladies t' ride him
better 'n he likes de gemmen."</p>

<p>"He means he doesn't want me to ride him?"</p>

<p>"Yassuh, da 's jes' his li'l idee 't he 's got <i>now</i>. He
be all right once you in de saddle."</p>

<p>"But how am I to get in the saddle if he keeps doing
that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hold 'im all right," said the groom. "You jes' get
on 'im, suh. He soon find out who 's boss."</p>

<p>"I think he will," said my heartless companion.</p>

<p>"Nevvah you feah, suh," the man said to me. "Ah
knowed the minute Ah saw yo' laigs 't you was a <i>horse</i>man.
Yassuh! Ah says t' ole Gawge, Ah says, 'Dat
gemman's certain'y been 'n de cava'ry, he has, wid dem
fine crooked laigs o' hisn.'"</p>

<p>"You should have told that to Dr. Bell, instead," suggested
my companion.</p>

<p>At this every one laughed. Even the groom laughed
a wheezy, cackling negro laugh. The situation was
becoming unbearable. Clearly I must try to mount.
Perhaps I should not succeed, but I must try. As I
was endeavoring to adjust my mind to this unpleasant
fact the Efficient Sister spoke.</p>

<p>"That horse is going to be ridden," she said firmly,
"if I have to go upstairs and dress and ride him myself."</p>

<p>That settled it.</p>

<p>"Now you hold him down," I said to the groom, and
stepped forward.</p>

<p>As I did so Dr. Bell reared again, simultaneously
drawing back sidewise and turning his flank away from
me, but this time the Efficient Sister hit him with a crop
she had found somewhere, and he came down hastily,
and began to dance a sort of double clog with all four
feet.</p>

<p>After several efforts I managed to get beside him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Gathering the reins in my left hand I put my foot up
swiftly, found the stirrup, and with a hop, managed to
board the beast.</p>

<p>As I did so, the groom let him go. Both stirrups
were short, but it was too late to discuss that, for by
the time I was adjusted to my seat we had traveled,
at a run, over a considerable part of the lawn and
through most of the flowerbeds. The shortness of the
stirrups made me bounce, and I had a feeling that I
might do better to remove my feet from them entirely,
but as I had never ridden without stirrups I hesitated
to try it now. Therefore I merely dug my knees desperately
into the saddle flaps and awaited what should
come, while endeavoring to check the animal. He,
however, kept his head down, which not only made it
difficult to stop him, but also gave me an unpleasant
sense as of riding on the cowcatcher of a locomotive
with nothing but space in front of me. Once, with a
jerk, I managed to get his head up, but when I did that
he reared. I do not care for rearing.</p>

<p>To add to my delight, one of the dogs now ran out
and began to bark and circle around us, jumping up at
the horse's nose and nipping at his heels. This brought
on new activities, for now Dr. Bell not only reared but
elevated himself suddenly behind, to kick at the dog.
However, there was one good result. We stopped running
and began to trot rapidly about in circles, dodging
the dog, and this finally brought us back toward the
house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"My stirrups are too short!" I shouted to the groom.</p>

<p>"Ride oveh heah, suh," he called back.</p>

<p>I tried to do it, but Dr. Bell continued to move in
circles. At last, however, the man managed to catch us
by advancing with his hand extended, as though offering
a lump of sugar, at the same time talking gently to my
steed. Then, while my companion held the bit the
negro adjusted the stirrup leathers. I was glad of the
breathing spell. I wished that it took longer to adjust
stirrups.</p>

<p>"You'd better go out by the drive this time," said the
Efficient Sister.</p>

<p>"I intended to before," I told her, "but he didn't seem
to understand the signals."</p>

<p>"You've got spurs on. Give him the spur."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I had hesitated to give him the
spur. It seemed to me that he was annoyed with me
anyway, and that the spur would only serve to increase
his prejudice. I wanted to rule him not by brute force
but by kindness. I wished that I could somehow make
him know that I was a regular subscriber to the S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.,
that I loved children and animals and all helpless
creatures, both great and small, that I used the dumb
brutes gently and only asked in return that they do the
same by me. But how is one to communicate such
humanitarian ideas to a big, stupid, wilful, perverse,
diabolical creature like a horse?</p>

<p>I was determined that when we started again we
should not run over the lawn if I could possibly pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>vent
it. Therefore I had the groom head the horse
down the drive, and the moment he released him, I
touched Dr. Bell with the spurs. The result was
magical. He started on a run but kept in the road
where I wanted him to be, giving me, for the moment, a
sense of having something almost like control over him.
At the foot of the drive was a gate which I knew could
be opened without dismounting, by pulling a rope, and
as no horse, unless quite out of his mind, will deliberately
run into a gate, I had reason to hope that Dr. Bell would
stop when he got there. Imagine my feelings, then,
when on sight of the gate he not only failed to slacken
his pace, but actually dashed at it faster than ever.
Within a few feet of the barrier he seemed to pause
momentarily, hunching himself in a peculiar and alarming
manner: then he arose, sailed through the air like a
swallow, came down beyond like a load of trunks falling
off from a truck, and galloped down the highway, seemingly
quite indifferent to the fact that the stirrups were
flapping at his sides and that I had moved from the
saddle to a point near the base of his neck.</p>

<p>My position at the moment was one of considerable
insecurity. By holding on to his mane and wriggling
backward I hoped to stay on, provided he did not put
down his head. If he did that, I was lost. Fortunately
for me, however, Dr. Bell did not realize with
what ease he could have dropped me at that moment,
and by dint of cautious but eager gymnastics, I managed
to regain the saddle and the stirrups, although in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
doing so I pricked him several times with the spurs, with
the result that, though he ran faster than ever for a
time, he must have presently concluded that I didn't
care how fast he went; at all events, he slackened his
pace to a canter, from which, shortly, I managed to
draw him down to a trot and then to a walk.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that not until now had we met any
vehicle. Even while he was running, even while I was
engaged in maintaining a precarious seat upon his neck,
I had found time to hope fervently that we should not
encounter an automobile. I was afraid that he would
jump it if we did.</p>

<p>Now, however, I saw a motor approaching. Dr. Bell
saw it, too, and pricked up his ears. Seizing the reins
firmly in one hand, I waved with the other, signalling to
the motorist to stop, which he did, pulling out into the
ditch. Meanwhile I talked to Dr. Bell, patting him on
the neck and telling him to go on and not to be afraid,
because it was all right. Dr. Bell did go on. He went
up to the front of the motor, past the side of it, and
on behind it, without showing the least sign of alarm.
He did not mind it at all. But the man in the motor
minded. Annoyed with me for having stopped him unnecessarily,
he shouted something after me. But I paid
no attention to him. Under the circumstances, it
seemed the only thing to do. I might have gotten off;
I might conceivably have beaten him; but I never could
have held the horse while doing it, or have gotten on
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently, when I was changing the position of the
reins, which were hurting my fingers because I had
gripped them so tight, I accidentally shifted the gears
in some way, so to speak, sending Dr. Bell off at a pace
which was neither a trot nor a canter, but which carried
us along at a sort of smooth, rapid glide. At first I took
this gait to be a swift trot, and attempted to post to it;
then, as that did not work, I sat still in the saddle and,
finding the posture comfortable, concluded that Dr. Bell
must be single-footing. I had never single-footed before.
Just as I was beginning to like it, however, he
changed to a trot, then back to single-footing again, and
so on, in a curious puzzling manner.</p>

<p>Except for the changes of gait, we were now going on
rather well, and I had begun, for the first time, to feel
a little security, when all of a sudden he swerved off
and galloped with me up a driveway leading toward a
white house which stood on a hill two or three hundred
yards from the road. Again I tried to stop him, but
when I pulled on the reins he shook his head savagely
from side to side and snorted in a loud and threatening
manner.</p>

<p>As we neared the house I saw that two ladies were sitting
on the porch regarding our approach with interest.
I hoped that Dr. Bell would find some way of keeping
on past the house and into the fields, but he had no such
intention. Instead of going by, he swung around the
circle before the porch, and stopped at the steps, upon
which the two ladies were sitting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>One of them was a white-haired woman of gentle
mien; the other was a girl of eighteen or twenty with
pretty, mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>Both the ladies looked up inquiringly as Dr. Bell and
I stopped.</p>

<p>I lifted my hat. It was the only thing I could think of
to do at the moment. At this they both nodded gravely.
Then we sat and stared at one another.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the old lady, when the silence had become
embarrassing.</p>

<p>I felt that I must say something, so I remarked:
"This is a very pretty place you have here."</p>

<p>At this, though the statement was quite true, they
looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"Is there any message?" asked the young woman,
after another pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I answered lightly. "I was riding by and
thought I'd take the liberty of coming up and telling
you&mdash;telling you that although I am a Northerner and a
stranger here, I love the South, the quaint old Southern
customs, the lovely old houses, the delicious waffles,
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is very gratifying," said she "I am sorry to say
we are all out of waffles at present."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want any now," I replied politely.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't mind my asking, what <i>do</i> you
want?"</p>

<p>"I want," I said, desperately, "to see your groom for a
moment, if possible."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's gone to town," she replied. "Is there anything
I can do? I see that your stirrup leather is twisted."
With that she arose, came down, removed my foot from
the stirrup, in a businesslike manner, reversed the iron,
and put my foot back for me.</p>

<p>I thanked her.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" she asked, her wicked eye twinkling.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I ventured, "perhaps you know how to
make a horse single-foot?"</p>

<p>"There are different ways," she said. "With Dr. Bell
you might try using the curb gently, working it from
side to side."</p>

<p>"I will," I said. "Thank you very much."</p>

<p>"And," said the girl, "if he ever takes a notion to bolt
with you, or to go up to some house where you don't
want him to go, just touch him with the curb. That
will fix him. He's very soft-bitted."</p>

<p>"But I tried that," I protested.</p>

<p>She looked at my reins, then shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you've got your curb rein and your
snaffle rein mixed."</p>

<p>"I am very much indebted to you," I said, as I changed
the position of the reins between my fingers.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said she. "I hope you'll get safely back
to the Claymont. If you want to jump him, give him
his head. He'll take off all right."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I returned. "I don't want to jump him."</p>

<p>Then lifting my hat and thanking her again, I wiggled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the curb gently from side to side, as directed, and departed,
singlefooting comfortably.</p>

<p>Dr. Bell and I got home very nicely. He wanted to
jump the gate again, but I checked him with the curb.
After pulling the rope to open the gate I must have got
the reins mixed once more, for as I was nearing the
house, calm in the feeling that I had mastered the animal,
and intent upon cantering up to the porch in fine
style, Dr. Bell swerved suddenly off to the stable, went
into the door, and, before I could stop him, entered his
stall.</p>

<p>There I dismounted in absolute privacy. It was
quite easy. I had only to climb on to the partition and
drop down into the next stall, which, by good fortune,
was vacant.</p>

<p>With a single exception, this was the only riding I did
in the South, and on the one other occasion of which I
speak I did not ride alone, but had, surrounding me, the
entire Eleventh United States Cavalry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<br />
INTO THE OLD DOMINION</h2>


<p>When two men are traveling together on an
equal footing, and it becomes necessary to
decide between two rooms in a hotel, how
is the decision to be made? Which man is to take the
big, bright corner room, and which the little room that
faces on the court and is fragrant of the bakery below?
Or again, which man shall occupy the lower berth in a
Pullman drawing-room, and which shall try to sleep
upon the shelf-like couch? Or when there is but one
lower left, which shall take the upper? If an extra
kit bag be required for the use of both, who shall pay
for it and own it at the journey's end? Who shall pay
for this meal and who for that? Or yet again, if there
be but one cheap heavy overcoat in a shop, and both desire
to own that coat, which one shall have the right of
purchase? Who shall tip the bell boy for bringing up
the bags, or the porter for taking down the trunks?
Who shall take home from a dance the girl both want
to take, and who shall escort the unattractive one who
resides in a remote suburb?</p>

<p>Between two able-bodied men there is no uncomfortable
complication of politeness in such matters. On a
brief journey there might be, but on a long journey the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
thin veil of factitious courtesy is cast aside; each wants
his fair share of what is best and makes no pretense to
the contrary.</p>

<p>Upon our first long journey together, some years ago,
my companion and I established a custom of settling
all such questions by matching coins, and we have maintained
this habit ever since. Upon the whole it has
worked well. We have matched for everything except
railroad fares and hotel bills, and though fortune has
sometimes favored one or the other for a time, I believe
that, had we kept accounts, we should find ourselves
to-day practically even.</p>

<p>Our system of matching has some correlated customs.
Now and then, for instance, when one of us is unlucky
and has been "stuck" for a series of meals, the other, in
partial reparation, will declare a "party." Birthdays
and holidays also call for parties, and sometimes there
will be a party for no particular reason other than that
we feel like having one.</p>

<p>Two of our parties on this journey have been given in
the basement caf&eacute; of the Shoreham Hotel in Washington.
Both were supper parties. The first I gave in
honor of my companion, for the reason that we both like
the Shoreham caf&eacute;, and that a party seemed to be about
due. That party brought on the other, which occurred
a few nights later and was given by us jointly in honor
of a very beautiful and talented young actress. And
this one, we agree, was, in a way, the most amusing of
all the parties we have had together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>It was early in the morning, when we were leaving the
caf&eacute; after the first party, that we encountered the lady
who caused the second one. I had never met her, but I
was aware that my companion knew her, for he talked
about her in his sleep. She was having supper with a
gentleman at a table near the door, and had you seen her
it would be unnecessary for me to tell you that my companion
stopped to speak to her, and that I hung around
until he introduced me.</p>

<p>After we had stood beside her, for a time, talking and
gazing down into her beautiful world-wise eyes, the
gentleman with whom she was supping took pity upon
us, and upon the waiters, whose passageway we blocked,
and invited us to sit down.</p>

<p>It was doubly delightful to meet her there in Washington,
for besides being beautiful and celebrated, she
had just come from New York and was able to give us
news of mutual friends, bringing us up to date on suits
for separation, alimony, and alienation of affections, on
divorces and remarriages, and all the little items one
loses track of when one has been away for a fortnight.</p>

<p>"I shall be playing in Washington all this week," she
said as we were about to leave. "I hope that we may
see each other again."</p>

<p>Whom did she mean by "we"? True, she looked at
my companion as she spoke, but he was seated at one
side of her and I at the other, and even with such eyes
as hers, she could not have looked at both of us at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
once. Certainly the hope she had expressed was shared
by me. <i>I</i> hoped that "we" might meet again, and it
seemed to me desirable at the moment that she should
understand (and that my companion should be reminded)
that he and I were as Damon and Pythias, as
Castor and Pollux, as Pylades and Orestes, and all that
sort of thing. Therefore I leaped quickly at the word
"we," and, before my companion had time to answer,
replied:</p>

<p>"I hope so too."</p>

<p>This brought her eyes to me. She looked surprised,
I thought, but what of that? Don't women like to be
surprised? Don't they like men to be strong, resolute,
determined, like heroes in the moving pictures? Don't
they like to see a man handle matters with dash? I was
determined to be dashing.</p>

<p>"We are off to Virginia to-morrow morning," I continued.
"We are going to Fredericksburg and Charlottesville,
and into the fox-hunting country. If we
can get back here Saturday night let's have a party."</p>

<p>I spoke of the hunting country debonairely. I did not
care what she thought my companion was going to the
hunting country for, but I did not wish her to think that
I was going only to look on. On the contrary, I desired
her to suppose that I should presently be wearing a pair
of beautiful, slim-legged riding boots and a pink coat,
and leaping a thoroughbred mount over fences and
gates. I wished her to believe me a wild, reckless, devil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of a fellow, and to worry throughout the week lest I be
killed in a fall from my horse, and she never see me more&mdash;poor
girl!</p>

<p>That she felt such emotions I have since had reason
to doubt. However, the idea of a party after the play
on Saturday night seemed to appeal to her, and it was
arranged that my companion and I should endeavor to
get back to Washington after the Piedmont Hunt races,
which we were to attend on Saturday afternoon, and
that if we could get back we should telegraph to her.</p>

<p>We kept our agreement&mdash;but I shall come to that
later.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Next morning we took train for Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>The city manager who runs the town is a good housekeeper;
his streets are wide, pretty, and clean; and
though there are many historic buildings&mdash;including
the home of Washington's mother and the house in
which Washington became a Mason&mdash;there are enough
good new ones to give the place a progressive look.</p>

<p>In the days of the State's magnificence Fredericksburg
was the center for all this part of northeastern Virginia,
and particularly for the Rappahannock Valley;
and from pre-Revolutionary times, when tobacco was
legal tender and ministers got roaring drunk, down to
the Civil War, there came rolling into the town the
coaches of the great plantation owners of the region,
who used Fredericksburg as a headquarters for drinking,
gambling, and business. Among these probably the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
most famous was "King" Carter, who not only owned
miles upon miles of land and a thousand slaves, but was
the husband of five (successive) Mrs. Carters.</p>

<p>Falmouth, a river town a mile above Fredericksburg,
where a few scattered houses stand to-day, was in early
times a busy place. It is said that the first flour mill in
America stood there, and that one Gordon, who made
his money by shipping flour and tobacco direct from his
wharf to England, and bringing back bricks as ballast
for his ships, was the first American millionaire.</p>

<p>Besides having known intimately such historic figures
as Washington, Monroe, and Robert E. Lee, and having
been the scene of sanguinary fighting in the Civil War,
the neighborhood of Fredericksburg boasts the birth-place
of a man of whom I wish to speak briefly here, for
the reason that he was a great man, that he has been
partially overlooked by history, and that it is said in the
South that the fame which should justly be his has been
deliberately withheld by historians and politicians for
the sole reason that as a naval officer he espoused the
southern cause in the Civil War.</p>

<p>Every one who has heard of Robert Fulton, certainly
every one who has heard of S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. Morse or Cyrus
W. Field, ought also to have heard of Matthew Fontaine
Maury. But that is not the case. For myself, I
must confess that, until I visited Virginia, I was ignorant
of the fact that such a person had existed; nor
have northern schoolboys, to whom I have spoken of
Maury, so much as heard his name. Yet there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
one living in the United States, or in any civilized country,
whose daily life is not affected through the scientific
researches and attainments of this man.</p>

<p>Maury's claim to fame rests on his eminent services
to navigation and meteorology. If Humboldt's work,
published in 1817, was the first great contribution to
meteorological science, it remained for Maury to make
that science exact.</p>

<p>While it is perhaps an exaggeration to say that
Maury alone laid the foundation for our present
Weather Bureau, he certainly shares with Professors
Redfield, Espy, Loomis, Joseph Henry, Dr. Increase
Lapham, and others, the honor of having been one of
the first to suggest the feasibility of our present systematic
storm warnings.</p>

<p>Maury was born in 1806. When nineteen years of
age he secured a midshipman's warrant, and, as there
was no naval academy at Annapolis then, was immediately
assigned to a man-of-war. Within six years he
was master of an American war vessel. Before starting
on a voyage to the Pacific he sought information on
the winds and currents, and finding that it was not available,
determined himself to gather it for general publication.
This he did, issuing a book upon the subject.</p>

<p>When a broken leg, the result of a stage-coach accident,
caused his retirement from active service at sea,
he continued his studies, and, in recognition of his services
to navigation, was given charge of the Depot of
Charts and Instruments at Washington. There he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
found stored away the log books of American naval
vessels, and from the vast number of observations they
contained, began the compilation of the Wind and Currents
Charts known to all mariners.</p>

<p>A monograph on Maury, issued by N.&nbsp;W. Ayer &amp;
Son, of Philadelphia, says of these charts:</p>

<p>"They were, at first, received with indifference and
incredulity. Finally, a Captain Jackson determined to
trust the new chart absolutely. As a result he made
a round trip to Rio de Janeiro in the time often required
for the outward passage alone. Later, four
clipper ships started from New York for San Francisco,
via Cape Horn. These vessels arrived at their
destination in the order determined by the degree of
fidelity with which they had followed the directions of
Maury's charts. The arrival of these ships in San
Francisco marked, likewise, the arrival of Maury's
Wind and Currents Charts in the lasting favor of the
mariners of the world. The average voyage to San
Francisco was reduced, by use of the charts, from one
hundred and eighty-three to one hundred and thirty-five
days, a saving of forty-eight days.</p>

<p>"Soon after this, the ship <i>San Francisco</i>, with hundreds
of United States troops on board, foundered in
an Atlantic hurricane. The rumor reached port that
there was need of help. Maury was called upon to
indicate her probable location. He set to work to show
where the wind and currents would combine to place
a helpless wreck, and marked the place with a blue pen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>cil.
There the relief was sent, and there the survivors
of the wreck were found. From that day to this,
Maury's word has been accepted without challenge by
the matter-of-fact men of the sea.</p>

<p>"These charts, only a few in number, are among the
most wonderful and useful productions of the human
mind. One of them combined the result of 1,159,353
separate observations on the force and direction of the
wind, and upward of 100,000 observations on the height
of the barometer, at sea. As the value of such observations
was recognized, more of them were made.
Through the genius and devotion of one man, Commander
Maury, every ship became a floating observatory,
keeping careful records of winds, currents, limits
of fogs, icebergs, rain areas, temperature, soundings,
etc., while every maritime nation of the world
co&ouml;perated in a work that was to redound to the benefit
of commerce and navigation, the increase of knowledge,
the good of all.</p>

<p>"In 1853, at the instance of Commander Maury, the
United States called the celebrated Brussels Conference
for the co&ouml;peration of nations in matters pertaining to
maritime affairs. At this conference, Maury advocated
the extension of the system of meteorological observation
to the land, thus forming a weather bureau
helpful to agriculture. This he urged in papers and
addresses to the close of his life. Our present Weather
Bureau and Signal Service are largely the outcome of
his perception and advocacy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Maury's "Physical Geography of the Sea," the work
by which he is best known, was published in 1855. He
discovered, among other things, the causes of the Gulf
Stream, and the existence of the still-water plateau of
the North Atlantic which made possible the laying of
the first cable. Cyrus W. Field said, with reference to
Maury's work in this connection: "Maury furnished
the brains, England gave the money, and I did the work."</p>

<p>Maury was decorated by many foreign governments
but not by his own. Owing, it is said, to his having
taken up the Confederate cause, national honors were
withheld from him, not only during the remainder of his
life, but until 1916, when one of the large buildings at
the Naval Academy&mdash;the establishment of which, by the
way, Maury was one of the first to advocate&mdash;was
named for him, and Congress passed a bill appropriating
funds for the erection of a monument to the "Pathfinder
of the Sea," in Washington.</p>

<p>Maury died in 1873, one of the most loved and honored
men in the State of Virginia.</p>

<p>It is recorded that, near the end, he asked his son:
"Am I dragging my anchors?"</p>

<p>And when the latter replied in the affirmative, the
father gave a brave sailor's answer:</p>

<p>"All's well," he said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Across the river from Fredericksburg stands Chatham,
the old Fitzhugh house, one of the most charming of
early Virginian mansions. Chatham was built in 1728,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and it is thought that the plans for it were drawn by
Sir Christopher Wren at the order of William Pitt,
Earl of Chatham, and sent by the latter to William
Fitzhugh, who had been his classmate at Eton and Oxford.
Not only does the name of the house lend color
to the tale, but so do its proportions, which are very
beautiful, reminding one somewhat of those of Doughoregan
Manor. Chatham, however, has the advantage
of being (as the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray wrote
of it in his quaint "Travels in North America," published
in 1839) "situated on an eminence commanding
a view of the town, and of the bold, sweeping course
of the Rappahannoc." Murray also tells of the beautiful
garden, with its great box trees and its huge slave-built
terraces, stepping down to the water like a giant's
stairway.</p>

<span class="caption">Chatham, the old Fitzhugh house, now the residence of Mark Sullivan. Washington, Madison, Monroe, Washington

</div>

<p>In this house my companion and I were guests, and
as I won the toss for the choice of rooms, mine was the
privilege of sleeping in the historic west bedchamber,
the principal guest room, and of opening my eyes, in the
morning, upon a lovely wall all paneled in white-painted
wood.</p>

<p>I shall always remember the delightful experience
of awakening in that room, so vast, dignified, and beautiful,
and of lying there a little drowsy, and thinking of
those who had been there before me. This was the
room occupied by George and Martha Washington when
they stopped for a few days at Chatham on their wedding
journey; this was the room occupied by Madison,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
by Monroe, by Washington Irving, and by Robert E.
Lee when he visited Chatham and courted Mary Custis,
who became his wife. And, most wonderful of all to
me, this was the room occupied by Lincoln when he came
to Fredericksburg to review the army, while Chatham
was Union headquarters, and the embattled Lee had
headquarters in the old house known as Brompton, still
standing on Marye's Heights back of the river and the
town. It is said that Lee during the siege of Fredericksburg
never trained his guns on Chatham, because
of his sentiment for the place. As I lay there in the
morning I wondered if Lee had been aware, at the time,
that Lincoln was under the roof of Chatham, and
whether Lincoln knew, when he slept in "my" room,
that Washington and Lee had both been there before
him.</p>

<p>War, I thought, not only makes strange bedfellows,
but strange combinations in the histories of bedrooms.</p>

<p>Then the maid rapped for the second time upon my
door, and though this time I got up at once, my ruminations
made me scandalously late for breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast came the motor, which was to take us
to the battlefields, its driver a thin dry-looking, dry-talking
man, with the air of one a little tired of the
story he told to tourists day in and day out, yet conscientiously
resolved to go through with it. Before the
huge cemetery which overlooks the site of the most violent
fighting that occurred in the bloody and useless
Battle of Fredericksburg, he paused briefly; then drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
us to the field of Chancellorsville, to that of the Battles
of the Wilderness, and finally to the region of Spottsylvania
Courthouse; and at each important spot he stopped
and told us what had happened there. He knew all
about the Civil War, that man, and he had a way of
passing out his information with a calm assumption that
his hearers knew nothing about it whatever. This
irritated my companion, who also knows all about the
War, having once passed three days in the neighborhood
of a Soldiers' Home. Consequently he kept cutting
in, supplying additional details&mdash;such, for instance,
as that Stonewall Jackson, who died in a house which
the driver pointed out, was shot by some of his own men,
who took him for a Yankee as he was returning from a
reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Either one of these competitive historians alone, I
could have stood, but the way they picked each other
up, fighting the old-time battles over again, got on my
nerves. Besides, it was cold, and as I have taken occasion
to remark before, I do not like cold motor rides.
Indeed, as I think it over, it seems to me I do not like
battlefields, either. At all events, I became more and
more morose as we traversed that bleak Virginia landscape,
and I am afraid that before the day was over I
was downright sulky.</p>

<p>As we drove back to Fredericksburg and to the train
which was to take us to Charlottesville, my companion
made remarks of a general character about people who
were trivial minded, and who didn't take a proper in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>terest
in the scenes of great historical occurrences.
When he had continued for some time in this vein, I
remarked feebly that I loved to read about battles; but
that, far from mitigating his severity, only caused him
to change his theme. He said that physical laziness
was a terrible thing because it not only made the body
soft but by degrees softened the brain, as well. He
said that when people didn't want to see battlefields,
preferring to lie in bed and read about them, that was
a sign of the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>On various occasions throughout the week he brought
this subject up again, and I was glad indeed when, as
the time for our party with the beautiful young actress,
in Washington, drew near, he began to forget about
my shortcomings and think of more agreeable things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

CHARLOTTESVILLE AND MONTICELLO</h2>


<p>When Virginians speak of "the university,"
they do not mean Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
or even Washington and Lee, but always the
University of Virginia, which is at Charlottesville.</p>

<p>The city of Charlottesville, in its downtown parts, is
no more and no less dingy and dismal than many another
town of six or seven thousand inhabitants, be it
North or South. It has a long main street, lined with
little shops and moving-picture shows, and the theatrical
posters which thrill one at first sight with hopes of evening
entertainment, prove, on inspection, to have survived
long after the "show" they advertise has come and
gone, or else to presage the "show" that is coming for
one night, week after next.</p>

<p>Nor is this scarcity of theatrical entertainment confined
alone to small towns of the South. Not all important
stars and important theatrical productions visit
even the largest cities, for the South is not regarded
by theatrical managers as particularly profitable territory.
It would be interesting to know whether an&aelig;mia
of the theater in the South, as well as the falling off
generally of theatergoing in lesser American cities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>&mdash;usually
attributed to the popularity and cheapness of the
"movies"&mdash;is not due in large measure to the folly of
managers themselves in sending out inferior companies.
Any one who has seen a theatrical entertainment
in New York and seen it later "on the road" is
likely to be struck by the fact that even the larger American
cities do not always get the full New York cast,
while smaller cities seldom if ever get any part of it.
The South suffers particularly in this respect. The
little "river shows," which arrive now and then in river
towns, and which are more or less characteristic of the
South, have the excuse of real picturesqueness, however
bad the entertainment given, for the players live and
have their theater on flatboats, which tie up at the
wharf. But the plain fact about the ordinary little
southern "road show" is that it does not deserve to
make money.</p>

<p>The life of a poor player touring the South must be
very wretched, for generally, excepting in large cities,
hotels are poor. Before we had gone far upon our way,
my companion and I learned to inquire carefully in
advance as to the best hotels, and when we found in
any small city one which was not a fire trap, and which
was clean, we were surprised, while if the service was
fairly good, and the meals were not very bad, we considered
it a matter for rejoicing.</p>

<p>We were advised to stop, in Charlottesville, at the
New Gleason, and when we alighted at the dingy old
brick railroad station&mdash;a station quite as unprepossess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ing
as that at New Haven, Connecticut&mdash;we began to
feel that all was not for the best. A large gray horse
hitched to the hack in which we rode to the Gleason evidently
felt the same, for at first he balked, and later tried
to run away.</p>

<p>The hotel lobby was a perfect example of its kind.
There were several drummers writing at the little desks,
and several more sitting idly in chairs adjacent to brass
cuspidors. All of them looked despondent with a despondency
suggesting pie for breakfast. Behind the
desk was a sleepy-looking old clerk who, as we arrived,
was very busy over a financial transaction involving
change of ownership in a two-cent stamp. This enterprise
concluded, he assigned us rooms.</p>

<p>Never have I wished to win the toss for rooms as I
wished it when I saw the two allotted to us, for though
the larger one could not by a flight of fancy be termed
cheerful, the sight of the lesser chamber filled me with
thoughts of madness.</p>

<p>Of course I lost.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget that room. It was too small to
accommodate my trunks with any comfort, so I left them
downstairs with the porter, descending, now and then,
to get such articles as I required. The furniture, what
there was of it, was of yellow pine; the top of the
dresser was scarred with the marks of many glasses and
many bottles; the lace window curtains were long, hard
and of a wiry stiffness, and the wall-paper was of a
scrambled pattern all in bilious brown. During the eve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ning
I persuaded my companion to walk with me through
the town, and once I got him out I kept him going on and
on through shadowy streets unknown to us, until, exhausted,
he insisted upon returning to our hostelry. I
fancy that there are picturesque old houses on the outskirts
of the town, but with that wall paper and a terrible
nostalgia occupying my mind, I was in no state to judge
of what was there.</p>

<p>On reaching the hotel my companion went to bed, but
I remained until late in the office, writing letters, doing
anything rather than go up to my room. When
at last I did ascend I planned to read, but the arrangement
of the light was bad, so presently I put it out and
lay there sleepless and miserable, thinking of foolish
things that I have said and done during a life rich with
such items, and having chills and fever over each separate
recollection. How I drifted off to sleep at last I
do not know; all I remember is waking up next morning,
leaping out of bed and dressing in frantic haste to get
out of my room. There was but one thing in it which
did not utterly offend the eye: that was the steam pipe
which ascended from floor to ceiling at one corner, and
which, being a simple, honest metal tube, was not objectionable.</p>

<p>As we passed through the office on our way to breakfast,
the bus man entered, and in a loud, retarded chant
proclaimed: "Train for the South!"</p>

<p>The impressive tones in which this announcement was
delivered seemed to call for a sudden stir, a rush for bags<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and coats, a general exodus, but no one in the office
moved, and I remember feeling sorry for the bus man as
he turned and went out in the midst of a crushing anti-climax.</p>

<p>"I wonder," I said to my companion, "if anybody ever
gets up and goes when that man calls out the trains."</p>

<p>"I don't believe so," he replied. "I don't think he
calls trains for any such purpose. He only warns people
so they will expect to hear the train, and not be frightened
when it goes through."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Thomas Jefferson is most widely remembered, I suppose,
as the author of the Declaration of Independence,
the third President, the purchaser of Louisiana, and the
unfortunate individual upon whom the Democratic party
casts the blame for its existence, precisely as the Republican
party blames itself on Washington and Lincoln&mdash;although
the lamentable state into which both parties
have fallen is actually the fault of living men.</p>

<p>It is significant, however, that of this trio of Jeffersonian
items, Jefferson himself selected but one to be
included in the inscription which he wrote for his tombstone&mdash;a
modest obelisk on the grounds at Monticello.
The inscription mentions but three of his achievements:
the authorship of the Declaration, that of the Virginia
statute for religious freedom, and the fact that he was
"Father of the University of Virginia."</p>

<p>Regardless of other accomplishments, the man who
built the university and the house at Monticello was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
great. It is more true of these buildings than of any
others I have seen that they are the autobiography, in
brick and stone, of their architect. To see them, to see
some of the exquisitely margined manuscript in Jefferson's
clean handwriting, preserved in the university library,
and to read the Declaration, is to gain a grasp of
certain sides of Jefferson's nature which can be achieved
in no other way.</p>

<p>Monticello stands on a lofty hilltop, with vistas, between
trees, of neighboring valleys, hills, and mountains.
It is a supremely lovely house, unlike any other,
and, while it is too much to say that one would recognize
it as the house of the writer of the Declaration, it is not
too much to say that, once one does know it, one can trace
a clear affinity resulting from a common origin&mdash;an
affinity much more apparent, by the way, than may be
traced between the work of Michelangelo on St. Peter's
at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and in his
"David."</p>

</div>

<p>The introductory paragraph to the Declaration
ascends into the body of the document as gracefully and
as certainly as the wide flights of easy steps ascend to
the doors of Monticello; the long and beautifully balanced
paragraph which follows, building word upon
word and sentence upon sentence into a central statement,
has a form as definite and graceful as that of the
finely proportioned house; the numbered paragraphs
which follow, setting forth separate details, are like
rooms within the house, and&mdash;I have just come upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
coincidence with a pleasant start such as might be felt by
the discoverer of some complex and important cipher&mdash;as
there are twenty-seven of the numbered paragraphs
in the Declaration, so there are twenty-seven rooms in
Monticello. Last of all there are two little phrases in
the Declaration (the phrases stating that we shall hold
our British brethren in future as we hold the rest of
mankind&mdash;"enemies in war; in peace, friends"), which
I would liken to the small twin buildings, one of them
Jefferson's office, the other that of the overseer, which
stand on either side of the lawn at Monticello, at some
distance from the house. These office buildings face,
and balance upon each other, and upon the mansion, but
they are so much smaller that to put them there required
daring, while to make them "compose" (as painters say)
with the great house, required the almost superhuman
sense of symmetry which Jefferson assuredly possessed.</p>

<p>The present owner of Monticello is Mr. Jefferson
Monroe Levy, former United States congressman from
New York. Mr. Levy is a Democrat and a bachelor, according
to the Congressional Directory, which states
further that he inherited Monticello from an uncle, Commodore
Uriah P. Levy, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., and that the latter purchased
the place in 1830 "at the suggestion of President
Jackson."</p>

<p>Dorothy Dix, writing in "Good Housekeeping," tells
a tale which I have heard repeatedly of the acquisition
of Monticello by Uriah Levy. Says Miss Dix:</p>

<p>"Monticello was sold to a stranger, and Jefferson's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
only daughter, Mrs. Randolph, widowed and with eleven
children, was left homeless.... A subscription of three
thousand dollars was raised ... to buy back the house ...
and this money was intrusted to a young relative of
the Jeffersons' to convey to Charlottesville. Traveling
in the stagecoach with the young man was Captain
Uriah P. Levy, to whom he confided his mission. The
young man became intoxicated and dallied, but Captain
Levy hastened on to Charlottesville, and purchased
Monticello for two thousand five hundred dollars. The
next day the repentant and sober young man arrived and
besought Captain Levy to take the three thousand dollars ...
and let Monticello go back to the Jefferson
family. Captain Levy refused to part with his bargain,
but at his death he willed Monticello to 'the people of
the United States to be held as a memorial of Thomas
Jefferson'.... The Levy heirs contested the will, and it
was finally decided upon a technicality that 'the people of
the United States' was too indefinite a term to make the
bequest binding, and the estate passed into the hands of
the Levys, and so to its present owner...."</p>

<p>In a biographical note upon the latter, the Congressional
Directory states that the house is "kept open to
the public all the year." My companion and I were admitted
to the grounds, but were informed that, though
the building was unoccupied, no one was permitted to
enter. While we were in the vicinity of the house we
were attended by one of the men employed on the place,
who told us that when people were allowed to roam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
about at will, there had been much vandalism; ivy had
been pulled from the walls, shrubbery broken, pieces of
brick chipped out of the steps, and teeth knocked from
the heads of the marble lions which flank them.</p>

<p>Of recent years there has been on foot a movement,
launched, I believe, by Mrs. Martin W. Littleton, of New
York, to influence the Government to purchase Monticello
from its present owner. It is difficult to see precisely
how Mr. Levy could be forced to part with his
property, if he did not wish to. Nevertheless public
sentiment on this subject has become so strong that he
has agreed to let the Government have Monticello "at a
price"&mdash;so, at least, I was informed in Charlottesville.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The opening of the University of Virginia was an event of prime importance
for the higher education in the whole country, and really marks
a new era.</p></div>

<p class="smcap signature">&mdash;Charles Forster Smith.</p>


<p>Like Monticello, the buildings of the University
of Virginia are those of an intellectual, a classicist,
a purist, and, like it, they might have been
austere but for the warmth of their red brick and the
glow of their white-columned porticos. But they are
cheerful buildings, which, individually and as a group,
attain a geometrical yet soft perfection, a supreme harmony
of form and color.</p>

<p>The principal buildings are grouped about a large
campus, called the Lawn, which is dominated by the rotunda,
suggesting in its outlines the Pantheon at Rome.
From the rotunda, at either side, starts a white-columned
arcade connecting the various houses which are distributed
at graceful intervals along the margins of the
rectangular lawn, above which loom the tops of even
rows of beautiful old trees. Flanking the buildings of
the lawn, and reached by brick walks which pass between
the famous serpentine walls (walls but one brick
thick which support themselves on the snake-fence principle,
by progressing in a series of reverse curves), are
the "ranges": solid rows of one-story student dormito<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>ries
built of brick and fronted by colonnades which command
other lawns and other trees.</p>

<p>With a single exception, restorations and additions to
the university have been made with reverence and taste,
and the Brooks Museum, the one architectural horror of
the place, fortunately does not stand upon the lawn.
Since it is said that beauty could not exist were there not
ugliness for contrast, this building may have its uses;
certainly, after a glance at it, one looks back with renewed
delight at the structures of the central group.</p>

<p>Most superb of all, always there hangs at night, above
the buildings and the tree-tops, a glorious full moon.
At least I suppose it always hangs there, for though it
seemed to us very wonderful, every one else seemed used
to it.</p>

<p>Like Venice, the University of Virginia should first
be seen by moonlight. There could not have been a
finer moonlit night, I thought, than that cold, crisp one
upon which my companion stood for two hours beside
the rotunda, gazing at the lawn and drawing it, its frosty
grass and trees decked with diamonds, its white columns
standing out softly from their shadow backgrounds like
phosphorescent ghosts in the luminous blue darkness.
Until I was nearly frozen I stayed there with him.
That drawing cost him one of the worst colds he ever
had.</p>

<p>The university ought to have, and has, many traditions,
and life there ought to be, and is, different from
life in any other college. Jefferson brought from Italy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the men who carved the capitals of the columns (the descendants
of some of these Italian workmen live in
Charlottesville to-day), and when the columns were in
place he brought from Europe the professors to form
the faculty, creating what was practically a small English
university in the United States. Never until, a
dozen years ago, Dr. E.&nbsp;A. Alderman became president,
had there been such an office; before that time the university
had a rector, and the duties of president were
performed by a chairman of the faculty, elected by the
faculty from among its members. This was the first
university to adopt the elective system, permitting the
students, as Jefferson wrote, "uncontrolled choice in the
lectures they shall attend," instead of prescribing one course
of reading for all. No less important, the
University of Virginia was the first college to introduce
(1842) the honor system, and still has the most complete
honor system to be found among American colleges.
This system is an outgrowth of the Jeffersonian
idea of student self-government; under it each
student signs, with examination papers, a pledge that
he has neither given nor received assistance. That is
found sufficient; students are not watched, nor need
they be. With time this system has been extended,
so that it now covers not only examinations, but many
departments of college life, eliminating professionalism
in athletics and plagiarism in literary work, and resulting
in a delightful mutual confidence between the student
body and the faculty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Madison and Monroe were active members of the
university's first board of visitors; the first college Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
was started there; and among many famous men
who have attended the university may be mentioned Edgar
Allan Poe, Thomas Nelson Page, and Thomas
Woodrow Wilson, whose name appears thus upon the
"University Magazine" for 1879-80, as one of its three
editors. The ill-starred Poe attended the university for
only one year, at the end of which time his adopted
father, Mr. Allan, of Richmond, withdrew him because
of debts he had contracted while acquiring his education
in gambling and drinking champagne. Poe's former
room, No. 13 West Range, is now the office of the
magazine.</p>

<p>The clean, lovely manuscript in Jefferson's handwriting,
of the first Anglo-Saxon grammar written in the
United States, is to be seen in the university library;
Jefferson was Vice-President of the United States when
he wrote it; he put Anglo-Saxon in the first curriculum
of the university, and it has been taught there ever since.
In a note which is a part of the manuscript, he advocates
the study of Anglo-Saxon as an introduction to modern
English on the ground that though about half the words
in our present language are derived from Latin and
Greek, these being the scholarly words, the other half,
the words we use most often, are Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>Before the war it was not uncommon for students at
the university to have their negro body servants with
them, and it has occasionally happened since that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
young sprig of southern aristocracy has come to college
thus attended.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking and characteristic feature
of student life to-day, from the point of view of the
stray visitor, is the formal attitude of students toward
one another. There is no easy-going casualness
between them, no calling back and forth, no "hello," by
way of greeting. They pass each other on the walks
either without speaking (men have been punished at
the university by being ignored by the entire student
body), or if they do greet each other the customary
salutation is "How are you, sir?" or "How are you,
gentlemen?" First-year men are expected to wear hats,
and not to speak to upper classmen until they have been
spoken to; and, though there is no hazing at the university,
woe betide them if they do not heed these rules.</p>

<p>In the early days of the university there was an effort
to exercise restraint over students, to make them account
for their goings and comings, and to prevent their going
to taverns or betting upon horse races. Also they were
obliged to wear a uniform. The severity was so great
that they appealed to Jefferson, who sided with them.
He, however, died in the same year, and friction prevailed
for perhaps a decade longer, with many student
disorders, culminating in the shooting of a professor by
a student. In 1840 the students were at last granted full
freedom, and two years later the honor system was
adopted.</p>

<p>During the university's first years young men from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the far South, where dueling was especially prevalent,
did not come in large numbers to the University of Virginia,
but went, as a rule, to the northern colleges,
but about the middle of the century, as feeling between
North and South over taxation, States' Rights
and slavery became more acute, these men began to flock
to the college at Charlottesville. Between 1850 and
1860 the university almost doubled in size, and at about
the same time there developed a good deal of dueling between
students.</p>

<p>When the War ended many men who had gone into
the Confederate army at sixteen or seventeen years of
age came to Charlottesville to complete their education.
The hard life of the army had made some of these into a
wild lot, and there was a great deal of gambling and
drinking during their time, and also after it, for several
succeeding generations of students looked up to the ex-soldiers
as heroes, and carried on the unfortunate traditions
left by them at the university. In the nineties,
however, a change came, and though there is still some
drinking and gambling, it is doubtful whether such vices
are now more prevalent at the University of Virginia
than at many other colleges. The honor system has
never been extended to cover these points.</p>

<p>It is related that, in Poe's time, gambling became such
a serious obstacle to discipline and work that the university
authorities set the town marshal after a score or
so of gambling students, Poe among them, whereupon
these students fled to the Ragged Mountains, near by,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and remained for two weeks, during which time Poe is
said to have mightily entertained them with stories and
prophecies, including a forecast of the Civil War, in
which, he declared, two of the youths present would fight
on opposite sides.</p>

<p>The Poe tradition is kept vigorously alive at the university.
Not long ago a member of the Raven Society,
one of the rather too numerous student organizations,
discovered the burial place of Poe's mother, who was
an actress, and who died penniless in Richmond at the
age of twenty-four and was buried with the destitute.
By a happy inspiration a fund was raised among the
students for the erection of a monument to her&mdash;an example
of fine and chivalrous sentiment on the part of
these young men, which, one feels, is somehow delicately
intertwined with the traditions of the honor system.</p>

<p>The Poe professor of English at the university, when
we were there, was Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, who has
since taken the professorship of English at the United
States Naval Academy. By a coincidence which has
proved a happy one for those who love the stories of the
late Sidney Porter (O. Henry), Dr. Smith grew up
as a boy with Porter, in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Because of this, and also because of Dr. Smith's own
gifts as a writer and an analyst, it is peculiarly fitting
that he should have undertaken the work which has occupied
him for several years past, the result of which
has recently been given to us in the form "The O. Henry
Biography."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Smith was Roosevelt exchange professor at the
University of Berlin in 1910-11, holding the chair of
American History and Institutions. While occupying
that professorship he met the Kaiser.</p>

<p>"I talked with him twice," he said, "and upon the
second occasion under very delightful circumstances,
for I was invited to dinner at the Palace at Potsdam, and
was the only guest, the Kaiser, Kaiserin, and Princess
Victoria Luise being present.</p>

<p>"The Kaiser is, of course, a very magnetic man.
His eyes are his most remarkable feature. They are
very large, brilliant, and sparkling, and he rolls them
in a manner most unusual. While he is always the
king and the soldier, he can be genial and charming.
One might expect a man in his position to be blas&eacute;, but
that, most of all, is what he is not. He is like a boy
in his vitality and vividness, and he has a great and persistent
intellectual curiosity. It is this, I think, which
used to cause him to be compared with Colonel Roosevelt.
Both would like to know all things, and both have
had, and have exercised more, perhaps, than any other
two living men, the power to bring to themselves the
central figures in all manner of world events, and thus
learn at first hand, from acknowledged authorities, about
the subjects that interest them&mdash;which is to say, everything.</p>

<p>"He frankly admired America. I don't mean that
he said so for the sake of courtesy to me, but that he
has&mdash;or did have, then&mdash;an immense and rather roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tic
interest in this country. A great many Germans
used to resent this trait in him. America held in his
mind the same romantic position that the idea of
monarchy did in the minds of some of us. I mean that
the average American went for romance to stories of
monarchy, but that the Kaiser, being used to the monarchial
idea, found his romance over here. (I am, of
course, speaking of him as he was five or six years ago.)
He wished to come to America, but was never able to do
so, since German law forbids it. And, perhaps because
he could not come, America was the more a sort of
dream to him.</p>

<p>"He asked me about some of the things in Berlin
which I had noticed as being different from things at
home, and when I mentioned the way that history was
kept alive in the very streets of Berlin, his eyes danced,
and he said that was one of the things he had tried
to accomplish by the erection of the numerous monuments
which have been placed in Berlin during his reign.
He told me of other means by which history was kept
alive in Germany: among them that every officer has
to know in detail the history of his regiment, and that
German regiments always celebrate the anniversaries of
their great days.</p>

<p>"He speaks English without an accent, though we
might say that he spoke it with an English accent. He
told me that he had learned English before he learned
German, and had also caused his children to learn it
first. He reads Mark Twain, or had read him, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
enjoyed him, but he said that when he met Mark Twain
the latter had little or nothing to say, and that it was
only with the greatest difficulty that he got him to talk
at all. He subscribed, he told me, to 'Harper's Magazine,'
and he was in the habit of reading short stories
aloud to his family, in English. He admired the American
short story, and I remember that he declared:
'The Americans know how to plunge into a short story.
We Germans are too long-winded.'"</p>

<p>When Professor Smith talks about the Kaiser, you
say to yourself: "I know that it is growing late, but
I cannot bear to leave until I have heard the rest of
this"; when he drifts presently to O. Henry, you say
the same; and so it is always, no matter what his subject.
At last, however, the grandfather's clock in the
hall below his study sends up a stern message which is
not to be mistaken, whereupon you arise reluctantly
from your comfortable chair, spill the cigar ashes out of
your lap onto the rug, dust off your clothing, and take
your leave. Nor is your regret at departing lessened
by the fact that you must go to your bilious-colored
bedroom in the New Gleason, and that you will not see
the university, or Professor C. Alphonso Smith, or Mrs.
Smith again, because you are leaving upon the morrow.</p>

<p>So it must always be with the itinerant illustrator and
writer. They are forever finding new and lovely scenes
only to leave them; forever making new and charming
friends only to part with them, faring forth again into
the unknown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>It is my impression that the dining-car conductor on
the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio train by which we left
Charlottesville was puzzled when I asked his name;
but if he sees this and remembers the incident he will
now know that I did so because I wished here to mention
him as a humane citizen. His name is C.&nbsp;G.
Mitchell, and he was so accommodating as to serve a
light meal, after hours, when he did not have to, to two
hungry men who needed it. If travel has taught my
companion and me anything, it has taught us that not
all dining-car conductors are like that. Nor, I judge,
can all dining-car conductors play the violin, pleasantly,
in off hours, as does Mr. Mitchell. Better one merciful
dining-car conductor than twenty who wear white carnations
at their left lapels, but wear no hearts below
them!</p>

<p>The road by which we drove from the railroad
into the fastnesses of Loudon County, where, near the
little settlement of Upperville, the race meet of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Piedmont Hunt was to be held, suggested other times
and other manners, for though we rode in a motor car,
and though we passed another now and then, machines
were far outnumbered by the horses which, under saddle,
or hitched to buggies, surreys, and carts of all descriptions,
were heading toward the meeting place.</p>

<p>On these roads, one felt, the motor was an outsider;
this was the kingdom of the horse that we were visiting;
soft dirt roads were there for him to trot and
gallop on, and fences of wood or stone, free from barbed
wire, were everywhere, for him to jump.</p>

<p>Throughout the week we had looked forward to this
day, and even more, perhaps, to the party which, if we
could get back to Washington that night, was to follow
it; wherefore the first thing we did on reaching a place
where information was obtainable was to inquire about
facilities for leaving. Herein my companion had the
advantage of me, for there was nothing to prevent his
departing immediately after the races, whereas I must
remain behind for an hour or two, to learn something of
fox-hunting as practised in this region.</p>

<p>By motoring immediately after the races to a neighboring
town&mdash;Bluemont if I remember rightly&mdash;and
there taking an interurban trolley to some other place,
and changing cars, and going without his dinner, my
companion found that he could get to Washington by
nine o'clock. My case was different. Should I be delayed
more than two hours I could not get away at all
that night, but must miss the much anticipated party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
altogether; and, though my companion seemed to view
this possibility with perfect equanimity, my memories
of the charming lady whom we were to meet at the
stage door, after the performance, were too clear to
permit of indifference in me. The trolley my companion
meant to catch was, however, the last one; my
only hope, therefore, was to motor a distance of perhaps
a dozen miles, over roads which I was frankly
told were "middling to bad," and try to catch a train
at The Plains station. If I missed this train, I was lost,
and must spend a solitary night in such a room as I
might be able to find in a strange village. That possibility
did not appeal to me. I began to wish that there
was no such thing as fox-hunting, or that, there being
such a thing, I had chosen to ignore it.</p>

<p>"Now," said my companion cheerfully, "we'll telegraph
her."</p>

<p>At a telegraph office he seized the pencil and wrote
the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Will call for you to-night after performance.</i></p></div>

<p>To this he signed his own name.</p>

<p>"What about me?" I suggested, after glancing over
his shoulder at the message.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said he, "there's no use in going into all
that in a telegram. It's sufficient to let her know that
one of us is coming."</p>

<p>"But I proposed this party."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he gave in, with an air of pained patience,
"what shall I say, then? Shall I add that you are unavoidably
detained?"</p>

<p>"Not by a jugful!" I returned. "Add that I hope to
get there too, and will make every effort to do so."</p>

<p>He wrote it out, sighing as he did so. Then, by careful
cutting, he got it down to fourteen words. By that
time the operator couldn't read it, so he wrote it out
again&mdash;gloomily.</p>

<p>This accomplished, we matched coins to see who
should pay for the message. He lost.</p>

<p>"All right!" he said. "I'll pay for it, but it's all foolishness
to send such a long telegram."</p>

<p>"No," I returned, as we left the office and got into the
machine, "it is not foolishness. If I can make life a
little brighter for a beautiful woman, by adding a few
words to a telegram, and sticking you for it, I shall do it
every time."</p>

<p>He looked away over the fields and did not answer
me. So we drove on in silence to where stands the beautiful
manor house called Huntland, which is the residence
of Mr. Joseph B. Thomas, M.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;H. of the Piedmont
Hunt.</p>

<p>There is, I have been told, no important hunt in the
United States in which the master of foxhounds is not
the chief financial supporter, the sport being a very
costly one. Of American hunts, the Middlesex, in Massachusetts,
of which Mr. A. Henry Higginson is M.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;H.,
has the reputation of being the best appointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
The Piedmont Hunt is, however, one of the half dozen
leading organizations of the kind, and it is difficult indeed
to imagine a finer.</p>

<p>In a well-kept park near Mr. Thomas's house stand
extensive English-looking buildings of brick and
stucco, which, viewed from a distance, suggest a beautiful
country house, and which, visited, teach one that
certain favored hounds and horses in this world live
much better than certain human beings. One building
is given over to the kennels, the other the stables; each
has a large sunlit court, and each is as beautiful and
as clean as a fine house&mdash;a house full of trophies, hunting
equipment, and the pleasant smell of well-cared-for
saddlery. In a rolling meadow, not far distant, is the
race course, all green turf, and here, soon after luncheon,
gathered an extraordinary diversified crowd.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="p180jpg" id="p180jpg"></a>
<img src="images/p180.jpg" width="600" height="462" alt="One party was stationed on the top of an old-time mail-coach bearing the significant initials &quot;F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;V.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">One party was stationed on the top of an old-time mail-coach bearing the significant initials &quot;F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;V.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For the most part the crowd was a fashionable one:
men and women of the type whose photographs appear
in "Vogue" and "Vanity Fair," and whose costumes
were like fashion suggestions for "sport clothes" in
those publications. One party was stationed on the
top of an old-time mail coach, the boot of which bore
the significant initials "F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;V."&mdash;standing, as even
benighted Northerners must be aware, for "First Families
of Virginia"; others were in a line of motors
and heterogeneous horse-drawn vehicles, parked beside
the course; and scattered through the gathering, like
brushmarks on an impressionist canvas, one saw the
brilliant color of pink coats. Handsome hunters were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
being ridden or led about by negro grooms, and others
kept arriving, ridden in by farmers and breeders, while
here and there one saw a woman rider, her hair tightly
drawn back under a mannish derby hat, her figure
slender and graceful in a severely-cut habit coat.
Jumbled together in a great green meadow under a
sweet autumnal sun, these things made a picture of
what, I am persuaded, is the ultimate in extravagant
American country life. There was something, too,
about this blending of fashionables and farmers, which
made me think of the theater; for there is, in truth, a
distinct note of histrionism about many of the rich
Americans who "go in for" elaborate ruralness, and there
is a touch of it very often, also, about "horsey" people.
They like to "look the part," and they dress it with no
less care than they exercise, at other seasons, in dressing
the parts of opera-going cosmopolites, or wealthy
loungers at the beaches. In other words, these fashionables
had the overtrained New York look all over
them, and the local rustics set them off as effectively
as the villainous young squire of the Drury Lane
melodrama is set off by contrast with honest old Jasper,
the miller, who wears a smock, and comes to the
Great House to beg the Young Master to "make an
honest woman" of poor Rose, the fairest lass in all
Hampshire.</p>

</div>

<p>About the races themselves there was something fascinatingly
nonprofessional. They bore the same relation
to great races on great tracks that a very fine perform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>ance
of a play by amateurs might bear to a professional
performance.</p>

<p>First came a two-mile steeplechase, with brush
hurdles. Then, after a couple of minor events, a four-mile
point-to-point race for hunters ridden by gentlemen
in hunt uniform. This was as stiff a race for
both horses and riders as I have ever seen, and it was
very picturesque to watch the pink coats careering up
hill and down dale, now over a tall stone wall, now over
a brook or a snake fence; and when a rider went head
over heels, and lay still upon the ground where he fell,
while his horse cantered along after the field, in that
aimless and pathetic way that riderless horses have, one
had a real sensation&mdash;which was the pleasanter for
knowing, a few minutes later, that the horseman had
only broken an arm.</p>

<p>Next was run a rollicking race for horses owned by
farmers, and others, whose land is hunted over by the
Piedmont and Middleburg foxhounds; and last occurred
a great comedy event&mdash;a mule race, free for all, in which
one of the hunting men, in uniform, made such a handsome
showing against a rabble of white and colored
boys, all of them yelling, all of them beating their long-eared
animals with sticks, that he would have won, had
he not deliberately pulled his mount and "thrown" the
race.</p>

<p>The last event was not yet finished when my companion,
who had become nervous about his interurban
trolley, got into a machine to drive to Bluemont.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," he said as we parted, "we'll miss you
to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "I hope not. I expect to get there."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can make it," said he. "You
have a lot of material to gather."</p>

<p>"I shall work fast."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, trying to speak like the voice of Conscience,
"I hope you won't forget your <i>duty</i>&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"I proposed this party to-night. It is my duty to be
there."</p>

<p>"You didn't make any definite engagement," said he,
"and, besides, your first duty is to your editors and your
readers."</p>

<p>Having tossed me this disgusting thought, he departed
in a cloud of dust, leaving me sad and alone, but not yet
altogether in despair.</p>

<p>The last race over, I hastened to Mr. Thomas's house,
which, by this time, looked like an old English hunting
print come to life, for it was now crowded with pink
coats. For most of the technical information contained
in this chapter I am indebted to various gentlemen
whom I encountered there.</p>

<p>In Virginia&mdash;which is the oldest fox-hunting State in
the Union, the sport having been practised there for
nearly two centuries&mdash;the words "hunt" or "hunting"
never by any chance apply to shooting, but always refer
to hunting the fox with horse and hounds. A "hunter"
is not a man but a horse; a huntsman is not a member
of the hunt but a hunt-servant; the "field" may be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
terrain ridden over by the hunt, or it may be the group
of riders following the hounds&mdash;"hunt followers,"
"hunting men," and "hunting women."</p>

<p>The following items, from "Baily's Hunting Directory,"
a British annual, give some idea of certain primary
formalities and practicalities of hunting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>HINTS TO BEGINNERS</p>

<p>Buy the best horses you can afford; but remember that a workably
sound horse, though blemished or a bit gone in the wind, will
give you plenty of fun, if you do not knock him about.</p>

<p>Obey the Master's orders without argument; in the field he is
supreme.</p>

<p>Hold up your hat if you view the fox away; do not halloa. If
none of the hunt servants see your uplifted hat, go and tell the
nearest of them.</p>

<p>Ride fast at water; if hounds clear a brook a horse has a good
chance of doing so. Steady your horse and let him take his own
pace at big timber.</p>

<p>Keep well away from hounds, and down wind of them at a
check. The steam from heated horses adds a fresh difficulty to
recovery of lost scent. Look out for signs that may indicate the
whereabouts or passing of the fox. Huddling sheep, staring cattle,
chattering magpies, circling rooks, may mean that they see,
or have just seen, the fox.</p>

<p>Never lark over fences; it tires your horse needlessly and may
cause damage and annoy the farmer.</p>

<p>Never take a short cut through a covert that is likely to be
drawn during the day; and keep well away from a covert that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
hounds are drawing if you start for home before the day's sport
is over, lest you head the fox.</p>

<p>Always await your turn at a gate or gap; do not try and push
forward in a crowd.</p>

<p>If you follow a pilot, do not "ride in his pocket"; give him
plenty of room, say fifteen lengths, at fences, or if he falls you
might jump on him.</p>

<p>If your horse kicks, tie a knot of red ribbon in his tail. N.&nbsp;B.&mdash;Do
not be guilty of using this "rogue's badge" for the sake of
getting room in a crowd, as some men have been known to do.</p>

<p>If a man is down and in danger of being kicked, put your own
saddle over his head.</p>


<p class='center'>HINTS CONCERNING THE HUNTER</p>

<p>It should be remembered that in the ordinary routine the horse
is fed three or four times a day. On a hunting day he gets one
good feed early in the morning and loses one or two feeds.
Moreover, he is doing hard work for hours together, with a
weight on his back. Carry a couple of forage biscuits in your
pocket to give him during the day. Also get off and relieve him
of your weight when you can do so.</p>

<p>When he is brought home, put him in his stall or box, slack
the girths, take off the bridle and give him his gruel at once.
Throw a rug over his loins and pull his ears for a minute or two.</p>

<p>An old horse needs more clothing than a young one.</p>

<p>Condition is a matter of seasons, not of months; a horse in
hard condition can take without injury a fall that would disable a
soft one for weeks.</p></div>

<p>In old times many of Virginia's country gentlemen
kept their own packs, but though some followed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
hounds according to the English tradition, there developed
a less sportsmanlike style of hunting called "hilltopping,"
under which the hunting men rode to an elevated
point and watched the hounds run the fox, without
themselves attempting to follow across country and
be in at the kill. As a result, the fox was, if caught,
torn to pieces by the hounds, and the brush and head
were infrequently saved.</p>

<p>Under the traditions of English fox-hunting&mdash;traditions
the strictness of which can hardly be exaggerated&mdash;"hilltopping"
is a more than doubtful sport, and, since
organized fox-hunting in the United States is taken entirely
from the English idea, the practice is tabooed on
first-class hunting regions.</p>

<p>The origin of hilltopping is, however, easily understood.
The old fox-hunters simply did not, as a rule,
have horses adequate to negotiate the country, hunters
not having been developed to any great extent in America
in early times.</p>

<p>The perfect type of hunter is of thoroughbred stock.
By the term "thoroughbred" horsemen do not mean
highly bred horses of any kind, as is sometimes supposed,
but only running horses. All such horses come
originally of British stock, for it is in Great Britain that
the breed has been developed, although it traces back,
through a number of centuries, to a foundation of
Arabian blood. I am informed that climatic and other
conditions in a certain part of Ireland are for some reason
peculiarly favorable to the development of hunters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and that these conditions are duplicated in the Piedmont
section of Virginia, and nowhere else in the
whole world. Only the stanchest, bravest, fastest type
of horse is suited for hunting in Virginia, and for this
reason the more experienced riders to hounds prefer
the thoroughbred, though half-bred and three-quarter-bred
horses are also used to some extent, the thoroughbred
often being too mettlesome, when he becomes excited,
for any but the best riders. The finest qualities
of a horse are brought out in hunting in the Piedmont
section, for the pace here is very fast&mdash;much faster than
in England, though it should be added that in the English
hunting country there are more hedges than over
here, and that the jumps are, upon the whole, stiffer.</p>

<p>The speed of the Piedmont Hunt and other hunts in
Virginia is doubtless due to the use of southern hounds,
these being American hounds, smaller and faster than
English hounds, from which, however, they were originally
bred. The desirable qualities in a pack of hounds
are uniformity of type, substance, speed, and color.
These points have to do not only with the style of a
pack, but also with its hunting quality. Thus in the
Piedmont pack they breed for a red hound with white
markings, so that the pack may have an individual appearance,
but in all packs a great effort is made to secure
even speed, for a slow hound lags, while a fast one
becomes an individual hunter. The unusual hound is
therefore likely to be "drafted" from the pack.</p>

<p>There has been a long controversy as to whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
English or American type of hound is best suited for
hunting in this country, and the matter seems still to
remain one of opinion. Probably the best English pack
in the United States is that of Mr. A. Henry Higginson.
Some years since, Mr. Higginson and Mr. Harry
Worcester Smith, of Worcester, Massachusetts, master
of the Grafton pack, made a bet of $5000 a side, each
backing his own hounds, the question being that of the
general suitability of the American versus the English
hound for American country. The trials were made in
the Piedmont region of Virginia, and Mr. Smith's
American hounds won the wager for him.</p>

<p>In the last ten or twenty years hunting in the United
States has been organized under the Hunts Committee
of the National Steeplechase Association. Practically
all the important hunting organizations are members of
this association, there being forty of these: eleven in
Virginia, nine in Pennsylvania, six in New York, four
in Massachusetts, three each in Maryland and New Jersey,
and one each in Connecticut, Vermont, Ohio, and
Michigan&mdash;the Grosse Pointe Hounds, near Detroit, being
the most westerly of recognized hunts, although
there is some unrecognized hunting near Chicago.</p>

<p>An idea of the comparative importance of hunting in
the United States and in England may be gathered from
the fact that in England and Wales alone there are more
than 180 packs of foxhounds, 88 packs of beagles, and
16 packs of staghounds, while Ireland and Scotland
have many also. The war, however, has struck hard at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
hunting in the British Isles. Baily's Hunting Directory
for 1915-16, says:</p>

<p>"Hunting has given her best, for of those who have
gone from the hunting field to join the colors, the masters
lead, as they have led in more happy days, with a
tale of over 80 per cent. of their number, the hunt secretaries
following with over 50 per cent., while the hunt
servants show over 30 per cent. No exact data are
available to tell of the multitude from the rank and file
that has followed this magnificent lead, excepting that
from all the hunts there comes the same report, that
practically every man fit for service has responded to
the call."</p>

<p>It is estimated that 17,000 horses were drafted from
hunting for the cavalry in England at the beginning
of the war; and it is to be noticed that so soon after
the outbreak as July, 1915, the "Directory" published
a list of names of well-known hunting men killed in action,
which occupied more than seven large pages printed
in small type.</p>

<p>Under the heading "Incidents of the 1914-15 Season"
are to be found many items of curious early war-time
interest, a few of which I quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lady Stalbridge announces willingness to act as field master of
the South and West Wilts Hounds during her husband's absence
in France.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charles Romer Williams took out to the front a
pack of beagles, with which the officers of the Second Cavalry
Brigade hoped to hunt Belgian hares.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. E.&nbsp;K. Bradbury, a member of the Cahir Harriers, earned
the V.&nbsp;C. at Nery, but died from wounds.</p>

<p>The Grafton Hounds have seventy-six followers with the colors.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir David Beatty, of North Sea fame, has a hunting
box at Brooksby Hall, in the Melton Mowbray country.</p>

<p>Five members of the Crawley and Horsham Hounds have
been killed, three wounded, and two are missing.</p>

<p>Quorn fields down to about 30, instead of 300 last season.</p>

<p>Captain the Honorable R.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;F. Robertson (Twenty-first Lancers)
a prisoner of war. He took over the North Tipperary
Hounds in May, and, of course, did not get a chance to have any
sport.</p>

<p>We now learn that the French authorities have discouraged
fox-hunting behind the fighting lines. So did the Germans.
One day British hounds took up the scent on their own initiative.
The usual followers had bigger game afoot, and were in the
thick of an engagement. The Germans gained ground and occupied
the kennels. When the hounds returned from their chase
and challenged the intruders they were shot down one by one.</p></div>

<p>Such is the lore I had acquired when the motor came
for me; whereupon, taking a few sandwiches to sustain
me until supper time, I set forth through the night
by Ford, for the station at The Plains.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The publication of the larger part of the foregoing
chapter on fox hunting, in "Collier's Weekly," brought
me a number of letters containing hunting anecdotes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. J.&nbsp;R. Smith of Martinsville, Virginia, calls my
attention to marked difference in character between the
red fox and the gray. The red fox, he says, depends
upon his legs to elude the hounds, and will sometimes
lead the hunt twenty-five miles from the place where he
gets up, but the gray fox depends on cunning, and is
more prone to run a few miles and "tack."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith tells the following story illustrative of the
gray fox's amazing artfulness:</p>

<p>"We had started a fox on three different occasions,"
he writes, "running him a warm chase for about four
miles and losing him every time in a sheep pasture.
Finally we stationed a servant in that pasture to see
what became of the fox. We started him again and
he took the same route to the pasture. There the mystery
was solved. The fox jumped on the back of a large
ram, which, in fright, ran off about half a mile. The
fox then jumped off and continued his run. When the
hounds came up we urged them on to the point where
the fox dismounted, and soon had his brush."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another correspondent calls my attention to the fact
that, in Virginia, hunting is not merely the sport of the
rich, but that the farmers are enthusiastic members of
the field&mdash;sometimes at the expense of their cattle and
crops. He relates the following story illustrative of the
point of view of the sporting Virginia farmer:</p>

<p>"A man from the Department of Agriculture came
down into our section to look over farms and give ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>vice
to farmers. He went to see one farmer in my
county and found that he had absolutely nothing growing,
and that his livestock consisted of three hunters
and thirty-two couples of hounds. The agricultural expert
was scandalized. He told the farmer he ought to
begin at once to raise hogs. 'You can feed them what
you feed the dogs,' he said, 'and have good meat for your
family aside from what you sell.'</p>

<p>"After hearing his visitor out, the farmer looked off
across the country and spat ruminatively.</p>

<p>"'I ain't never seen no hawg that could catch a fox,'
he said, and with that turned and went into the barn,
evidently regarding the matter as closed. Clearly he
did not share the view of the Irishman who dismissed
fox hunting with the remark that a fox was 'damned
hard to catch and no good when you got him.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The motor ride to The Plains was a cold and
rough one. I remember that we had to ford a
stream or two, and that once, where the mud had
been churned up and made deep by the wheels of many
vehicles, we almost stuck. Excepting at the fords, the
road was dusty, and the dust was kept in circulation by
the feet of countless saddle horses, on which men from
the country to the south of Upperville were riding home
from the races. All the way to The Plains our lights
kept picking up these riders, sometimes alone, sometimes
in groups, all of them going our way, we taking
their dust until we overhauled them, then giving them
ours.</p>

<p>Dust was over me like a close-fitting gray veil when
I reached the railroad station only to find that the train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
was late. I had a magazine in my bag, but the light
in the waiting-room was poor, so I took a place near
the stove and gave myself up to anticipations of a bath,
a comfortable room, clean clothing, and a good supper
with my companion&mdash;and another companion much
more beautiful.</p>

<p>I tried to picture her as she would look. She would
be in evening dress, of course. After thinking over different
colors, and trying them upon her in my mind, I
decided that her gown should be of a delicate pink, and
should be made of some frail, beautiful material which
would float about her like gossamer when she moved,
and shimmer like the light of dawn upon the dew. You
know the sort of gown I mean: one of those gowns upon
which a man is afraid to lay his finger-tips lest the material
melt away beneath them; a gown which, he feels,
was never touched by seamstress of the human species,
but was made by fairies out of woven moonlight, star
dust, afterglow, and the fragrance of flowers. Such a
gown upon a lovely woman is man's proof that woman
is indeed the thing which so often he believes her&mdash;that
she is more goddess than earthly being; for man knows
well that he himself is earthly, and that a costume made
from such dream stuffs and placed on him, would not
last out the hour. He has but to look up at the stars
to realize the infinity of space, and, similarly, but to
look at her in her evening gown to realize the divinity of
woman.</p>

<p>And that is where she has him. For it isn't so!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>At last came the train&mdash;just the dingy train to stop
at such a station. I boarded it, found a seat, and continued
to dream dreams as we rattled on toward Washington.</p>

<p>Even when I found myself walking through that great
terminal by which all railroads enter the capital, I
hardly believed that I was there, nor did I feel entirely
myself until I had reached my room in the New Willard.</p>

<p>Having started my bath, I went and knocked upon
the door of the near-by room where the clerk had told
me I should find my fellow traveler.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, without enthusiasm as he discovered
me. "You're here, are you?"</p>

<p>He looked imposing and severe in his evening dress.
I felt correspondingly dirty and humble.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied meekly. "Any news?"</p>

<p>"None," he replied. "I've reserved a table at Harvey's.
They dance there. At first they said there was
not a table to be had&mdash;Saturday night, you know&mdash;but
I told them who was to be with us, and they changed
their minds."</p>

<p>"Good. I'll be dressed in a little while. Silk hats?"</p>

<p>He nodded. I returned to my own room.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later, my toilet completed, I rejoined
him, and together we descended, in full regalia,
to the lobby.</p>

<p>"Shall we take a taxi?" he suggested, as we passed
out of the side entrance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far away is the theater?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>We asked the carriage starter. He said it was only
two or three blocks.</p>

<p>"Let's walk," I said.</p>

<p>"I don't feel like walking," he returned.</p>

<p>We rode.</p>

<p>The theater was just emptying when we arrived.</p>

<p>"I suppose we'd better let the cab go?" I said.
"There'll be quite a while to wait while she's changing."</p>

<p>"Better keep it," he disagreed. "Might not find another."</p>

<p>We kept it.</p>

<p>At the stage door there was confusion. Having completed
its week in Washington, the play was about to
move elsewhere, and furniture was already coming out
into the narrow passage, and being piled up to be taken
on wagons to the train. It took us some time to find
the doorman, and it took the doorman&mdash;as it always does
take doormen&mdash;a long, long time to depart into the unknown
region of dressing rooms, with the cards we gave
him, and a still longer time to return.</p>

<p>"Says to wait," he grunted when he came back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile more and more furniture had come out,
menacing our shins and our beautifully polished hats
in passing, and leaving us less room in which to stand.</p>

<p>We waited.</p>

<p>After ten minutes had passed, I remarked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we had let the taxi go."</p>

<p>After twenty minutes I remarked:</p>

<p>"I always feel like an idiot when I have to wait at a
stage door."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you do it, then," said he.</p>

<p>"And I hate it worse when I'm in evening dress. I
hate the way the actors look at us, when they come out.
They think we're a couple of Johnnies."</p>

<p>"And supposing they do?"</p>

<p>I do not know how long this unsatisfactory dialogue
might have continued had not some one come to the
inside of the stage door and spoken to the doorman,
whereat he indicated us with a gesture and said:</p>

<p>"There they are."</p>

<p>At this a woman emerged. The light was dim, but I
saw that she wore no hat and had on an apron. As she
came toward us we advanced.</p>

<p>"You wait for madame?" she asked, with the accent
of a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Madame receive your telegram only this afternoon,"
she said. "All week, she say, she wait to hear. This
morning she have receive a telegram from Mr. Woods
that say she mus' come to New York. She think you
not coming, so she say 'Yes.' Then she receive your
message. She don't know where to reach you. She
can do nossing. She is desolated! She mus' fly to the
train. She is ver' sorry. She hope that maybe the
gentlemans will be in Baltimore nex' week? Yes?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean she can't come to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur. She cannot. She are fill with regret.
She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said my companion, recovering, "we can
drive her to the train?"</p>

<p>The maid, however, did not seem to wish to discuss
this point. She shook her head and said:</p>

<p>"Madame ver' sorry she cannot come."</p>

<p>"But I say," repeated my companion, "that we shall be
delighted to drive her to the train if she wishes."</p>

<p>"She ver' sorry," persisted the maid negatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," he said. "Very well. Please say to her
that we are sorry, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur." The maid retired.</p>

<p>"I want something to eat," I remarked as we passed
down the long furniture-piled passage leading to the
street.</p>

<p>"So do I. We have that table at Harvey's."</p>

<p>"I know; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," he put in. "I mentioned her name.
We can't very well go there without her."</p>

<p>"And all dressed up like a pair of goats."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There's always the hotel."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back there&mdash;not now."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. Let's make it the Shoreham," I suggested
as we emerged upon the street.</p>

<p>"All right." Then, looking across the sidewalk, he
added: "There's that damned taxi!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. We'll drive around there in it."</p>

<p>"No," said he, "send it away. I don't feel like riding."</p>

<p>We walked to the Shoreham. The caf&eacute; looked cheerful,
as it always does. We ordered an extensive supper.
It was good. There were pretty women in the
room, but we looked at them with the austere eyes of
disillusioned men, and talked cynically of life. I cannot
recall any of the things we said, though I remember
thinking at the time that both of us were being rather
brilliant, in an icy way. I suppose it was mainly about
women. That was to be expected. Women, indeed!
What were women to us? Nothing! And pretty
women, least of all. Ah, pretty women! Pretty
women!... Yes, yes!</p>

<p>I had ordered fruit to finish off the meal, and I remember
that as the dish was set upon the table, it occurred
to me that we had made a very pleasant party of
it after all.</p>

<p>"Do you know," I said, as I helped myself to some
hothouse grapes, "I've had a bully evening. It has
been fine to sit here and have a party all to ourselves.
I'm not so sorry that she did not come!"</p>

<p>Then I ate a grape or two.</p>

<p>They were very handsome grapes, but they were sour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The last time I went abroad, a Briton on the boat
told me a story about an American tourist who
asked an old English gardener how they made
such splendid lawns over there.</p>

<p>"First we cut the grass," said the gardener, "and then
we roll it. Then we cut it, and then we roll it."</p>

<p>"That's just what we do," said the American.</p>

<p>"Ah," returned the gardener, "but over here we've
been doing it five hundred years!"</p>

<p>In Liverpool another Englishman told me the same
story. Three or four others told it to me in London.
In Kent I heard it twice, and in Sussex five or six times.
After going to Oxford and the Thames I lost count.</p>

<p>In the South my companion and I had a similar experience
with the story about that daughter of the Confederacy
who declared she had always thought "damn
Yankee" one word. In Maryland that story amused us,
in Virginia it seemed to lose a little of its edge, and we
are proud to this day because, in the far southern States,
we managed to grin and bear it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless the young lady likewise thought that "you-all"
was one word. However I refrained from suggesting
that, lest it be taken for an attempt at retaliation.
And really there was no occasion to retaliate, for
the story was always told with good-humored appreciation
not only of the dig at "Yankees"&mdash;collectively all
Northerners are "Yankees" in the South&mdash;but also of
the sweet absurdity of the "unreconstructed" point of
view.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly of the South, I believe that there
survives little real bitterness over the Civil War and the
destructive and grotesquely named period of "reconstruction."
When a southern belle of to-day damns
Yankees, she means by it, I judge, about as much, and
about as little, as she does by the kisses she gives young
men who bear to her the felicitous southern relationship
of "kissing cousins."</p>

<p>Even from old Confederate soldiers I heard no expressions
of violent feeling. They spoke gently, handsomely
and often humorously of the war, but never
harshly. Real hate, I think, remains chiefly in one
quarter: in the hearts of some old ladies, the wives and
widows of Confederate soldiers&mdash;for there are but few
mothers of the soldiers left. The wonder is that more
of the old ladies of the South have not held to their resentment,
for, as I have heard many a soldier say,
women are the greatest sufferers from war. One veteran
said to me: "My arm was shattered and had to
be amputated at the shoulder. There was no anesthetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Of course I suffered, but I never suffered as my mother
did when she learned what I had endured."</p>

<p>Be they haters of the North or not, the old ladies of
the South are among its chief glories, and it should be
added that another of those glories is the appreciation
that the South has for the white-haired heroines who
are its mothers, grandmothers, and great grandmothers,
and the unfailing natural homage that it pays them. I
do not mean by this merely that children and grandchildren
have been taught to treat their elders with respect.
I do not mean merely that they love them. The thing
of which I speak is beyond family feeling, beyond the
respect of youth for age. It is a strong, superb sentiment,
something as great as it is subtle, which floods
the South, causing it to love and reverence its old ladies
collectively, and with a kind of national spirit, like the
love and reverence of a proud people for its flag.</p>

<p>Among young men, I met many who told me, with
suitable pride, of the parts played by their fathers and
uncles in the war. Of these only one spoke with heat.
He was a Georgian, and when I mentioned to him
that, in all my inquiries, I had heard of no cases of
atrocious attacks upon women by soldiers&mdash;such attacks
as we heard of at the time of the German invasion
of Belgium and France&mdash;he replied with a great
show of feeling that I had been misinformed, and that
many women had been outraged by northern soldiers
in the course of Sherman's march to the sea. At this
my heart sank, for I had treasured the belief that, de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>spite
the roughness of war, unprotected women had
generally been safe from the soldiers of North and
South alike. What was my relief, then, on later receiving
from this same young man a letter in which he declared
that he had been mistaken, and that after many
inquiries in Georgia he had been unable to learn of a
single case of such crime. If it is indeed true that such
things did not occur in the Civil War&mdash;and I believe confidently
that it is true&mdash;then we have occasion, in the
light of the European War, to revise the popular belief
that of all wars civil war is the most horrible.</p>

<p>The attitude of the modern South (the "New South"
which, by the way, one Southerner described to me as
meaning "northern capital and smoke") toward its
own "unreconstructed" citizens, for all its sympathy and
tenderness, is not without a glint of gentle humor.
More than once, when my companion and I were received
in southern homes with a cordiality that precluded
any thought of sectional feeling, we were nevertheless
warned by members of the younger generation&mdash;and
their eyes would twinkle as they said it&mdash;to "look
out for mother; she's unreconstructed." And you may
be sure that when we were so warned we did "look
out." It was well to do so! For though the mother
might be a frail old lady, past seventy, with the face
of an angel and the normal demeanor of a saint, we
could see her bridle, as we were presented to her, over
the thought there here were two Yankees in her home&mdash;Yankees!&mdash;we
could see the light come flashing up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
into her eyes as they encountered ours, and could
feel beneath the veil of her austere civility the dagger
points of an eternal enmity. By dint of self-control
on her part, and the utmost effort upon ours to be
tactful, the presentation ceremony was got over with,
and after some formal speeches, resembling those
which, one fancies, may be exchanged by opposing generals
under a flag of truce, we would be rescued from
her, removed from the room, before her forbearance
should be strained, by our presence, to the point of breaking.
A baleful look would follow us as we withdrew,
and we would retire with a better understanding of the
flaming spirit which, through that long, bloody conflict
against overwhelming odds in wealth, supplies, and
men, sustained the South, and which at last enabled
it to accept defeat as nobly as it had accepted earlier
victories.... How one loves a gentle old lady who can
hate like that!</p>

<p>In this chapter, when it appeared originally, in "Collier's
Weekly," I made the statement that I had seldom
spent an hour in conversation with a Southerner without
hearing some mention of the Civil War, and that I
had heard other Northerners remark upon this matter,
and express surprise at the tenacity with which the war
holds its place in the foreground of the southern mind.</p>

<p>This, like many another of my southern observations,
brought me letters from readers of "Collier's," residing
in the South. A great number of the letters thus elicited,
as well as comments made upon these chapters by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the southern press, have been of no small interest to me.
On at least one subject (the question discussed in the
next chapter, as to whether the expression "you-all" is
ever used in the singular) my correspondents have convinced
me that my earlier statement was an error, while
on other subjects they have modified my views, and on
still others made my convictions more profound.
Where it has been possible, and where it has seemed, for
one reason or another, to be worth while, I have endeavored,
while revising the story of my southern wanderings
for this book, to make note of the other fellow's
point of view, especially in cases where he disagrees
with me.</p>

<p>The following, then, is from a letter written on the
stationery of Washington and Lee University, and applies
to certain statements contained in this chapter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In 1813, Thomas Jefferson wrote to a newspaper publisher:
"Were I the publisher of a paper, instead of the usual division
into Foreign, Domestic, etc., I think I should distribute everything
under the following heads: 1. True. 2. Probable. 3. Wanting
confirmation. 4. Lies, and be careful in subsequent papers to
correct all errors in preceding ones."</p>

<p>Allow me to suggest that your story might, under Mr. Jefferson's
category, be placed under "2." Perhaps you went to see
"The Birth of a Nation" before you wrote it. It has been my
experience that my acquaintances among the F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;V.'s have
been far more interested in whether Boston or Brooklyn would
win the pennant than in discussing the Civil War. By the young
men of the South the War was forgotten long ago.</p></div>

<p>This letter has caused me to wonder whether the frequency
with which my companion and I heard the Civil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
War discussed, may not, perhaps, have been due, at
least in part, to our own inquiries, resulting from the
consuming interest that we had in hearing of the War
from those who lived where it was fought.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, it seems to me most natural that the
South should remember, while the North forgets.
Not all Northerners were in the war. But all Southerners
were; if a boy was big enough to carry a gun, he
went. The North almost completely escaped invasion,
and upon one occasion when a southern army did march
through northern territory, the conduct of the invading
troops toward the civilian population (the false Barbara
Frietchie legend to the contrary notwithstanding) was
so exemplary as to set a record which is probably unequaled
in history.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The South, upon the other hand,
was constantly under invasion, and the record of destruction
wrought by northern armies in the valley of
the Shenandoah, on the March to the Sea, and in some
other instances, is writ in poverty and mourning unto
this day.</p>

<p>Thus, except politically, the North now feels not the
least effect from the war. But the South knew the
terrors of invasion and the pangs of conquest, and is
only growing strong again after having been ruined&mdash;as
instanced by the fact, which I came across the other
day, that the tax returns from one of the southern
States have, for the first time since the Civil War,
reached the point at which they stood when it began.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>So, very naturally, while the War has begun to
take its place in the northern mind along with the
Revolutionary War, as something to be studied in school
under the heading "United States History," it has not,
in southern eyes, become altogether "book history," but
is history that lives&mdash;in swords hanging upon the walls
of many homes, in old faded letters, in sacks of worthless
Confederate bills, in the ruins of great houses, in
lovingly preserved gray uniforms, in southern battle
fields, and in southern burial grounds where rows upon
rows of tombstones, drawn up in company front, stand
like gray armies forever on parade.</p>

<p>Small wonder if, amid its countless tragic memorials,
the South does not forget. The strange thing is that bitterness
has gone so soon; that remembering the agonies
of war and the abuses of reconstruction, the South does
not to-day hate the North as violently as ever. If to err
is human, the North has, in its treatment of the South,
richly proved its humanness; and if forgiveness is divine,
the South has, by the same token, attained something
like divinity.</p>

<p>Had the numbskull North understood these things as
it should have understood them, there would not now be
a solid Democratic South.</p>

<p>Such rancor as remains is, I believe, strongest in the
smaller towns in those States which suffered the greatest
hardships. I know, for instance, of one lady, from
a little city in Virginia, who refused to enter the Massachusetts
Building at the Chicago World's Fair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
there are still to be found, in Virginia, ladies who do
not leave their houses on the Fourth of July because
they prefer not to look upon the Stars and Stripes. The
Confederate flag is still, in a sense, the flag of the South.
Southerners love it as one loves a pressed flower from
a mother's bridal wreath. When the Eleventh Cavalry
rode from Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, to Winchester,
Virginia, a few years since, they saw many Confederate
flags, but only one Union flag, and that in the hands of
a negro child. However, war had not then broken out
in Europe. It would be different now.</p>

<p>A Virginia lady told me of having gone to a dentist
in Winchester, Virginia, and having taken her little
niece with her. The child watched the dentist put a
rubber dam in her aunt's mouth, and then, childlike, began
to ask questions. She was a northern child, and
she had evidently heard some one in the town speak of
Sheridan's ride.</p>

<p>"Auntie," she said, "was Sheridan a Northerner or a
Southerner?"</p>

<p>Owing to the rubber dam the aunt was unable to reply,
but the dentist answered for her. "He was a
drunken Yankee!" he declared vehemently.</p>

<p>When, later, the rubber dam was removed, the aunt
protested.</p>

<p>"Doctor," she reproved, "you should not have said
such a thing to my niece. She is from New York."</p>

<p>"Then," returned the unrepentant dentist, "she has
heard the truth for once!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless this man was an inheritor of hate, like the
descendants of one uncompromisingly bitter old Southerner
whose will, to be seen among the records of the
Hanover County courthouse, in Virginia, bequeaths to
his "children and grandchildren and their descendants
throughout all future generations, the bitter hatred and
everlasting malignity of my heart and soul against the
Yankees, including all people north of Mason and
Dixon's line."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who write school histories and wish them
adopted by southern schools have to handle
the Civil War with gloves. Such words as
"rebel" and "rebellion" are resented in the South, and
the historian must go softly in discussing slavery,
though he may put on the loud pedal in speaking
of State Rights, the fact being that the South not
only knows now, but, as evidenced by the utterances
of her leading men, from Jefferson to Lee, knew
long before the war that slavery was a great curse;
whereas, on the question of State Rights, including
the theoretical right to secede from the Union&mdash;this
being the actual question over which the South took
up arms&mdash;there is much to be said on the southern
side. Colonel Robert Bingham, superintendent of the
Bingham School, Asheville, North Carolina, has made
an exhaustive study of the question of secession, and
has set forth his findings in several scholarly and temperately
written booklets.</p>

<p>Colonel Bingham proves absolutely, by quotation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
their own words, that the framers of the Constitution
regarded that document as a <i>compact</i> between the several
States. He shows that three of the States (Virginia,
New York, and Rhode Island) joined in this compact
<i>conditionally</i>, with the clear purpose of resuming
their independent sovereignty as States, should the general
government use its power for the oppression of the
States; that up to the time of the Mexican War the
New England States contended for, not against, the
right to secede; that John Quincy Adams went so far
as to negotiate with England with a view to the secession
of the New England States, because of Jefferson's
Embargo Act, and moreover that up to 1840 the United
States Government used as a textbook for cadets at
West Point, Rawle's "View of the Constitution," a book
which teaches that the Union is dissoluble. Robert E.
Lee and Jefferson Davis, were, therefore, in all probability,
given this book as students at West Point, and
consequently, if we would have honest history, we must
face the astonishing fact that there is evidence to show
<i>that they learned the doctrine of secession at the United
States Military Academy</i>.</p>

<p>Colonel Bingham, who, it may be remarked, served
with distinction in the Confederate Army, has very
kindly supplemented, in a letter to me, his published
statements. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Secession was legal <i>theoretically</i>, but practically the conditions
on which the thirteen Independent Republics, covering a little
strip on the Atlantic coast, came to an agreement, could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
possibly be applied to the great inter-Oceanic Empire into which
these thirteen Independent Republics had developed.</p>

<p>"Theory is a good horse in the stable, but may make an arrant
jade on the journey"&mdash;to paraphrase Goldsmith&mdash;and the only
way in which these irreconcilable differences could be settled was
by bullet and bayonet, which settled them right and finally.</p></div>

<p>Once such matters as these are fully understood in the
North, there will be left but one grave issue between
North and South, that issue being over the question of
whether or not Southerners, under any circumstances,
use the phrase "you-all" in the singular.</p>

<p>"Whatever you write of the South," said our hostess
at a dinner party in Virginia, "don't make the mistake
of representing any one from this paht of the country,
white oh black, educated oh ignorant, as saying 'you-all'
meaning one person only."</p>

<p>When I remarked mildly that it seemed to me I had
often seen the phrase so used in books, and heard it in
plays, eight or ten southern ladies and gentlemen at the
table pounced upon me, all at once. "Yes!" they agreed,
with a kind of polite violence, "books and plays by
Yankees!"</p>

<p>"If," one of the gentlemen explained, "you write to
a friend who has a family, and say, according to the
northern practice, 'I hope to see you when you come to
my town,' you write something which is really ambiguous,
since the word 'you' may refer only to your friend,
or may refer also to his family. Our southern 'you-all'
makes it explicit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>I told him that in the North we also used the word
"all" in connection with "you," though we accented the
two evenly, and did not compound them, but he seemed
to believe that "you" followed by "all" belonged exclusively
to the South.</p>

<p>The argument continued almost constantly throughout
the meal. Not until coffee was served did the subject
seem to be exhausted. But it was not, for after
pouring a demi-tasse our hostess lifted a lump of sugar
in the tongs, and looking me directly in the eye inquired:
"Do you-all take sugah?"</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it would have been wiser, and politer,
to let this pass, but the discussion had filled me with
curiosity, not only because of my interest in the localism,
but also because of the amazing intensity with which it
had been discussed.</p>

<p>"But," I exclaimed, "you just said 'you-all,' apparently
addressing me. Didn't you use it in the singular?"</p>

<p>No sooner had I spoken than I was sorry. Every one
looked disconcerted. There was silence for a moment.
I was very much ashamed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said at last. "When I said 'you-all' I
meant you and Mr. Morgan." (She pronounced it
"Moh-gan," with a lovely drawl.) As she made this
statement, she blushed, poor lady!</p>

<p>Being to blame for her discomfiture, I could not bear to
see her blush, and looked away, but only to catch the eye
of my companion, and to read in its evil gleam the
thought: "Of course they use it in the singular. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
aren't you ashamed of having tripped up such a pretty
creature on a point of dialect?"</p>

<p>Though my interest in the southern idiom had caused
me to forget about the sugar, my hostess had not forgotten.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, still balancing the lump above the
cup, and continuing gamely to put the question in the
same form, and to me: "Do you-all take sugah, oh
not?"</p>

<p>I had no idea how my companion took his coffee, but
it seemed to me that tardy politeness now demanded that
I tacitly&mdash;or at least demi-tacitly&mdash;accede to the alleged
plural intent of the question. Therefore, I replied: "Mr.
Morgan takes two lumps. I don't take any, thanks."</p>

<p>Late that night as we were returning to our hotel, my
companion said to me somewhat tartly: "In case such
a thing comes up again, I wish you would remember that
sugar in my coffee makes me ill."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you say so?"</p>

<p>"Because," he returned, "I thought that you-all ought
to do the answering. It seemed best for me-all to keep
quiet and try to look plural under the singular conditions."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>No single thing I ever wrote has brought to me so
many letters, nor letters so uniform in sentiment (albeit
widely different in expression), as the foregoing, seemingly
unimportant tale, printed originally in "Collier's
Weekly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one has pointed out that various communities
have "fighting words," and as the letters poured in I
began to realize that in discussing "you-all" I had inadvertently
hit upon a term which aroused the ire of the
South&mdash;or rather, that I had aroused ire by implying
that the expression is sometimes used in the singular&mdash;the
Solid South to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Never, upon any subject, have I known people to agree
as my southern correspondents did on this. The unanimity
of their dissent was an impressive thing. So was
the violence some of them displayed.</p>

<p>For a time, indeed, the heat with which they wrote,
obscured the issue. That is to say, most of them instead
of explaining merely denied, and added comments, more
or less unflattering, concerning me.</p>

<p>Wrote a lady from Lexington, Kentucky:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have lived in Kentucky all of my life, and have never yet
heard "you-all" used in the singular, not even among the negroes.
My grandparents and friends say they have never heard it, either.</p>

<p>It was needless for you to tell your Virginia hostess that "you-all"
(meaning you and your friend) were Yankees. The fact
that you criticized her language proved it. Southern people
pride themselves on their tact, and no doubt, at the time, she
was struggling to conceal a smile because of some of your own
localisms.</p></div>

<p>Many of the letters were more severe than this one,
and most of them made the point that I had been impolite
to my hostess, and that, in all probability, when
she looked at me and asked, "Do you-all take sugah?"
she was playing a joke upon me, apropos the discussion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
which had preceded the question. For example, this,
from a gentleman of Pell City, Alabama:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My wife is the residuary legatee of Virginia's language, inherited,
acquired and affected varieties, including the vanishing
<i>y</i>; annihilated <i>g</i>; long-distance <i>a</i>, and irresistible drawl.</p>

<p>To quell the unfortunate tumult that has arisen in our household
as a result of your last article in "Collier's" I am commanded
to advise you that the use of "you-all" in the singular
is absodamnlutely <i>non est factum</i> in Virginia, save, perhaps,
among the hill people of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>Also, take notice that when your hostess, with apparent inadvertence,
used the expression in connection with sugar in your
demi-tasse, the subsequent blush was due to your failure to catch
her witticism, ignorantly mistaking it for a lapse of hers.</p>

<p>My wife was going to write to you herself, but I managed to
divert this cruel determination by promising to uphold the honor
of the Old Dominion. There is already too much blood being
shed in the world without spilling that of non-combatants as
would have been "you-all's" fate had she gone after you with a
weapon more mighty than the sword when in the hands of Mr.
Wilson or an outraged woman.</p></div>

<p>In face of all this and much more, however, my conviction
was unshaken. I talked it over with my companion.
He remembered the episode of the dinner table
exactly as I did. Moreover, I still had my notes, made
in the hotel that night. The lady looked at me. My
companion was several places removed from her at the
other side of the table. How could she have meant to
include him? And how could she have expected me to
say how he took his after-dinner coffee?</p>

<p>At last, to reassure myself, I wrote to the wisest, clev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>erest,
most trustworthy lady in the South, and asked her
what it all meant.</p>

<p>"Well," she wrote back from Atlanta, "I will tell you,
but I am not sure that you will understand me. The answer
is: <i>She did, but she didn't</i>. She looked at and
spoke to you and, of course, by all rules of logic she
could not have been intending to make you Morg's
keeper in the matter of coffee dressing. <i>But</i> she never
would have said 'you-all' if Morg had not been in her
mind as joined with you. The response, according to
her thought-connotation, would have been from you <i>and</i>
from him."</p>

<p>This was disconcerting. So was a letter, received in
the same mail, from a gentleman in Charleston:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is as plain as the nose on your face that you are not yet convinced
that we in the South <i>never</i> use "you-all" with reference
to one person. The case you mentioned proves nothing at all.
The very fact that there were <i>two</i> strangers present justified the
use of the expression; we continually use the expression in that
way, and in such cases we expect an answer from <i>both</i> persons
so addressed. To illustrate: just a few days ago I "carried"
two girls into an "ice-cream parlor." After we were seated,
I looked at the one nearest me, and said: "Well, what will
you-all have?"</p>

<p>Physically we are so constructed that unless a person is cross-eyed
it is impossible to look at two persons at once; the mere fact
that I looked at the one nearest me did not mean that I was not
addressing both. I expected an answer from both, and I got it,
too (as is generally the case where ice-cream is concerned).</p>

<p>The subject is one to which I have devoted the most careful
attention for many years. I have been so interested in it that
almost unconsciously, whenever I myself use the expression "you-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>all,"
or hear any one else use it, I note whether it is intended to
refer to one or to more than one person. I have heard thousands
of persons, white, black and indifferent, use the expression,
and the only ones I have ever heard use it incorrectly are what
we might call "professional Southerners." For instance, last
week I went to a vaudeville show, and part of the performance
was given by two "black-face" comedians, calling themselves
"The Georgia Blossoms." Their dialect was excellent, with the
single exception that one of them <i>twice</i> used the expression "you-all"
where it could not <i>possibly</i> have meant more than one person.
And I no sooner heard it than I said to myself: "There
is <i>one</i> blossom that never bloomed in Georgia!"</p>

<p>Another instance is the following: I was once approached by
a beggar in Atlanta, who saluted me thus: "Say, mister, can't
you-all give me a nickel?" Had I been accompanied it would
have been all right, but I was alone, and there was no other person
near me except the hobo. Did I give him the nickel? I
should say not! I said to myself: "He is a damned Yankee
trying to pass himself off for a Southerner."</p></div>

<p>Horrid glimmerings began to filter dimly through.
And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Next day came a letter calling my attention to an article,
written years ago by Joel Chandler Harris and
Thomas Nelson Page, jointly, in which they plead with
northern writers not to misuse the disputed expression
by applying it in the singular.</p>

<p>That was another shock. I felt conviction tottering....
But she <i>did</i> look at me.... She <i>didn't</i> expect an
answer from my companion....</p>

<p>And then behold! a missive from Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Jones, a
member&mdash;and a worthy one&mdash;of the Tallapoosa County
Board of Education, and a resident of Dadeville, Ala<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>bama.
Mr. Jones' educational activities reach far beyond
Tallapoosa County, and far beyond the confines
of his State, for he has educated me. He has made me
see the light.</p>

<p>"I want to straighten you out," he wrote, kindly.
"We never use 'you-all' in the singular. Not even the
most ignorant do so. But, as you know," (Ah, that was
mercifully said!) "there are some peculiar, almost unexplainable,
shades of meaning in local idioms of speech,
which are not easy for a stranger to understand. I have
a friend who was reared in Milwaukee and is a graduate
of the University of Wisconsin, who tells me he
would have argued the 'you-all' point with all comers
for some years following his taking up his residence
here, but he is at this time as ready as I to deny the allegation
and 'chaw the alligator.'</p>

<p>"When your young lady, in Virginia, asked, 'Do you-all
take sugar?' she mentally included Mr. Morgan, and
perhaps all other Yankees. I would ask my local grocer,
'Will you-all sell me some sugar this morning?'
meaning his establishment, collectively, although I addressed
him personally; but I would <i>not</i> ask my only
servant, 'Have you-all milked the cow?'"</p>

<p>And that is the exact truth.</p>

<p>I was absolutely wrong. And though, having printed
the ghastly falsehood in my original article, I can hardly
hope now for absolution from the outraged South, I
can at least retract, as I hereby do, and can, moreover,
thank Mr. H.&nbsp;E. Jones, of Tallapoosa County, Alabama,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
for having saved me from a double sin; for had he
not given me the simple illustration of the grocery store,
I might have repeated, now, my earlier misstatement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<br />
IDIOMS AND ARISTOCRACY</h2>


<p>Southerners have told me that they can tell
from what part of the South a person comes,
by his speech, just as an Easterner can distinguish,
by the same means a New Englander, a
New Yorker, a Middle-Westerner, and a Brooklynite.
I cannot pretend to have become an authority upon
southern dialect, but it is obvious to me that the speech
of New Orleans is unlike that of Charleston, and that of
Charleston unlike that of Virginia.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of the Virginian dialect is the
famous and fascinating localism which Professor C. Alphonso
Smith has called the "vanishing <i>y</i>"&mdash;a <i>y</i> sound
which causes words like "car" and "garden" to be pronounced
"cyar" and "gyarden"&mdash;or, as Professor Smith
prefers to indicate it: "C<sup>y</sup>ar" and "g<sup>y</sup>arden." I am
told that in years gone by the "vanishing <i>y</i>" was common
to all Virginians, but though it is still common
enough among members of the old generation, and is
used also by some young people&mdash;particularly, I fancy,
young ladies, who realize its fetching quality&mdash;there can
be no doubt that it is, in both senses, vanishing, and that
not half the Virginians of the present day pronounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"cigar" as "segyar," "carpet" as "cya&acute;pet," and "Carter,"
as "Cyahtah."</p>

<p>In Virginia and many other parts of the South one
hears such words as "aunt" correctly pronounced with
the broad <i>a</i>, and such words as "tube" and "new" properly
given the full <i>u</i> sound (instead of "toobe," and
"noo," as in some parts of the North); but, on the other
hand, while the South gives the short <i>o</i> sound in such
words as "log" and "fog," it invariably calls a dog a
"dawg." "Your" is often pronounced "yore," "sure"
as "shore," and, not infrequently, "to" as "toe."</p>

<p>The South also uses the word "carry" in a way that
strikes Northerners as strange. If a Southerner offers
to "carry" you to the station, or over his plantation, he
does not signify that he intends to transport you by
means of physical strength, but that he will escort you.
If he "carries you to the run" you will find that the
"run" is what Northerners call a creek; if to the
"branch," or "dreen," that is what we call a brook.</p>

<p>This use of the word "carry," far from being a corruption,
is pure old English, and is used in the Bible, and
by Smollett, though it is amusing to note that the "Georgia
Gazetteer" for 1837, mentions as a lamentable provincialism
such an application of the word as "to <i>carry</i>
(instead of <i>lead</i>) a horse to water." If the "Gazetteer"
were indeed correct in this, then the Book of Genesis
contains an American provincialism.</p>

<p>The customary use of the word in the North, as "to
<i>carry</i> a cane, or a bag," is equally but no more correct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
than the southern usage. I am informed by Mr. W.&nbsp;T.
Hall, Editor of the Dothan (Alabama) "Eagle," that
the word used in his part of the country, as signifying
"to bear on the back, or shoulder," is "tote." "Tote"
is a word not altogether unknown in the North, and it
has recently found its way into some dictionaries,
though the old "Georgia Gazetteer" disapproved of it.
Even this word has some excuse for being, in that it is a
deformed member of a good family, having come from
the Latin, <i>tollit</i>, been transformed into the early English
"tolt," and thus into what I believe to be a purely American
word.</p>

<p>Other expressions which struck me as being characteristic
of the South are "stop by," as for instance, "I
will stop by for you," meaning, "I will call for you in
passing"; "don't guess," as "I don't guess I'll come";
and "Yes indeedy!" which seems to be a kind of emphatic
"Yes indeed."</p>

<p>"As I look back over the old South," said one white-haired
Virginian, "there were two things it was above.
One was accounts and the other was grammar. Tradesmen
in prosperous neighborhoods were always in distress
because of the long credits, though gambling debts
were, of course, always punctiliously paid. As to the
English spoken in old Virginia&mdash;and indeed in the whole
South&mdash;there is absolutely no doubt that its softness and
its peculiarities in pronunciation are due to the influence
of the negro voice and speech on the white race. Some
of the young people seem to wish to dispute this, but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
older ones used to take the view&mdash;half humorously, of
course&mdash;that if a Southerner spoke perfect English, it
showed he wasn't a gentleman; "that he hadn't been
raised with niggers around him.""</p>

<p>"Oh, you shouldn't tell him that!" broke in a lady who
was present.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"He'll print it!" she said.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "ain't it true? What's the
harm in it?"</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed. "You said '<i>ain't</i>.' He'll
print that Virginians say 'ain't'!"</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "I reckon we do, don't we?"</p>

<p>She laughed and gave up. "I remember," she told me,
"the very spot on the turnpike going out to Ripon, where
I made up my mind to break myself of saying 'ain't.'
But I want to tell you that we are talking much better
English than we used to. Even the negroes are. You
don't hear many white people saying 'gwine' for 'going'
any more, for instance, and the young people don't say
'set' for 'sit' and 'git' for 'get,' as their fathers did."</p>

<p>"I've heard folks say, though," put in the old gentleman,
"that they'd ruther speak like a Virginian than
speak correctly. The old talk was pretty nice, after all.
I don't hold to all these new improvements. They've
been going too far in this Commonwealth."</p>

<p>"What have they been doing?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Doing!" he returned, "Why, they're gradually taking
the cuspidors out of the church pews!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the question of dialect is dropped, it should be
said that those who do not believe the soft southern
pronunciation is derived from negroes, can make out
an interesting case. If, they ask, the negro has corrupted
the English of the South, why is it that he has
not also corrupted the language of the West Indies&mdash;British
and French? French negroes speak like French
persons of white blood, and British West Indian negroes
often speak the cockney dialect, without a trace of "nigger."
Moreover, it is pointed out that in southern
countries, the world over, there is a tendency to soften
the harsh sounds of language, to elide, and drop out
consonants. The Andalusians speak a Spanish comparable
in many of its peculiarities with the English of
our own South, and the south-Italians exhibit similar
dialectic traits. Nor do the parallels between the north
and south of Spain and Italy, and of the United States,
end there. The north-Italians and north-Spaniards are
the "Yankees" of their respective countries&mdash;the
shrewd, cold business people&mdash;whereas the south-Italians
and south-Spaniards are more poetic, more
dashing, more temperamental. The merchants are of
the north of Spain, but the dancers and bull-fighters are
Andalusians. And just as our Americans of the North
admire the lazy dialect of the South, so the north-Spaniards
admire the dialect of Andalusia, and even
imitate it because they think it has a fashionable sound&mdash;quite
as British fashionables cultivate the habit of
dropping final <i>g</i>'s, as in "huntin'" for "hunting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia, more than any other State I know of, feels
its entity as a State. If you meet a Virginian traveling
outside his State, and ask where he is from, he will not
mention the name of the city in which he resides, but will
reply: "I'm from Va'ginia." If, on the other hand,
you are in Virginia, and ask him the same question, he
will proudly reply: "I'm from Fauquier," or "I'm
from Westmoreland," or whatever the name of his
county may be. The chances are, also, that his trunks
and traveling bags will be marked with his initials, followed
not by the name of his town, but by the abbreviation,
"Va."</p>

<p>I was told of one old unreconstructed Virginian who
had to go to Boston on business. The gentleman he
went to see there was exceedingly polite to him, asking
him to his house, putting him up at his club, and showing
him innumerable courtesies. The old Confederate, writing
to his wife, indicated his amazement: "Although
he is not a Virginian," he declared, "I must confess that
he lives like a gentleman."</p>

<p>The name of his Bostonian acquaintance was John
Quincy Adams.</p>

<p>I heard this story from a northern lady who has a
country place near a small town in Virginia. In the
North this lady's family is far from being unknown, but
in Virginia, she assured me, all persons originating outside
the State are looked upon as vague beings without
"family."</p>

<p>"They seem to think," she said, "that Northerners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
have no parents&mdash;that they are made chemically."</p>

<p>This does not imply, however, that well-bred Northerners
are excluded from society. Even if they are well
off they may get into society; for though money does not
count in one's favor in such a town, it does not count
against one. The social requirement of the place is
simple. If people are "nice people," that is enough.</p>

<p>Of course, however, it is one thing to be admitted to
Virginia society and another to belong to it by right. A
case in point is that of a lady visiting in a Virginia city
who, while calling at the house of some "F.&nbsp;F.V's," was
asked by a little girl, the daughter of the house, where she
had been born.</p>

<p>"Mawtha," said the little girl's mother, after the caller
had departed, "you must not ask people where they were
bo'n. If they were bo'n in Va'ginia they will tell you
so without asking, and if they weren't bo'n in Va'ginia
it's very embarrassing."</p>

<p>Some of the old families of the inner circle are in a
tragic state of decay, owing to inbreeding; others, in a
more wholesome physical and mental condition, are perpetually
wrestling with the heritage of poverty left over
from the War&mdash;"too proud to whitewash and too poor
to paint"&mdash;clinging desperately to the old acres, and
to the old houses which are like beautiful, tired ancestral
ghosts.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago the one resource of Virginian
gentlewomen in need of funds was to take boarders, but
more lately the daughters of distinguished but poverty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>stricken
families have found that they may work in offices.
Thus, in the town of which I speak, several ladies
who are very much "in society," support themselves by
entertaining "paying guests," while others are stenographers.
The former, I was told, by the way, make it
a practice to avoid first-hand business contacts with their
guests by sending them their bills through the mail, and
requiring that response be made by means of the same
impersonal channel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Richmond is the Boston of Virginia; Norfolk
its New York. The comparison does not, of
course, hold in all particulars, Richmond being,
for instance, larger than Norfolk, and not a seaport.
Yet, on the other hand, Boston manages, more than any
seaport that I know of, to conceal from the visitor the
signs of its maritime life; wherefore Richmond looks
about as much like a port as does the familiar part of
Boston.</p>

<p>The houses on the principal residence streets of Richmond
are not built in such close ranks as Boston houses;
they have more elbow-room; numbers of them have yards
and gardens; and there is not about Richmond houses the
Bostonian insistence upon red brick; nevertheless many
houses of both cities give off the same suggestion of having
long been lived in by the descendants of their builders.
So, too, though the Capitol at Richmond has little
architectural resemblance to Boston's gold-domed State
House&mdash;the former having been copied by Thomas
Jefferson from the Maison Carr&eacute;e at N&icirc;mes, and being a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
better building than the Massachusetts State House,
and better placed&mdash;the two do, nevertheless, suggest
each other in their gray granite solidity.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in the quality of solidity&mdash;architectural,
commercial, social, even spiritual&mdash;that Richmond and
Boston are most alike. Substantialness, conservatism,
tradition, and prosperity rest like gray mantles over both.</p>

<p>Broad Street in Richmond is two or three times as
wide as Granby Street, Norfolk's chief shopping street,
and for this reason, doubtless, its traffic seems less,
though I believe it is in fact greater. A fine street
to look upon at night, with its long, even rows of
clustered boulevard lights, and its bright windows,
Broad Street in the daytime is a disappointment, because,
for all its fine spaciousness, it lacks good buildings.
I must confess, too, that I was disappointed in the
appearance of the women in the shopping crowds on
Broad Street; for, as every one knows, Richmond has
been famous for its beauties. In vain I looked for
young women fitted to inherit the d&eacute;butante mantles of
such nationally celebrated beauties as Miss Irene Langhorne
(Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson), Miss May Handy
(Mrs. James Brown Potter), Miss Lizzie Bridges (Mrs.
Hobson), and Miss Sally Bruce (Mrs. Arthur B. Kinsolving).</p>

<p>In the ten years between 1900 and 1910 the population
of Richmond increased 50 per cent. Her population
by the last census was about 130,000, of which a
third is colored. Norfolk's population is about 70,000,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
with approximately the same percentage of negroes.
In both cities there is much new building&mdash;offices downtown,
and pretty new brick homes in outlying suburban
tracts. Likewise, in both, the charming signs of other
days are here and there to be seen.</p>

<p>Richmond is again like its ancient enemy, Boston, in
the wealth of its historical associations, and I know of
no city which gives the respectful heed to its own history
that Richmond does, and no State which in this
matter equals the State of Virginia. If Richmond was
the center of the South during the Civil War, Capitol
Square was, as it is to-day, the center of that center.
In this square, in the shadow of Jefferson's beautiful
classic capitol building, which has the glowing gray tone
of one of those water colors done on tinted paper by
Jules Gu&eacute;rin, Confederate soldiers were mustered into
service under Lee and Jackson. Within the old building
the Confederate Congress met, Aaron Burr was tried
for treason, and George Washington saw, in its present
position, his own statue by Houdon. Across the way
from the square, where the post office now stands, was
the Treasury Building of the Confederate States, and
there Jefferson Davis appeared seven times, to be tried
for treason, only to have his case postponed by the Federal
Government, and finally dismissed. East of the
square is the State Library, containing a remarkable collection
of portraits and documents, including likenesses
of all governors of Virginia from John Smith to Tyler,
a portrait of Pocahontas, and the bail bond of Jefferson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Davis, signed by Horace Greeley, Cornelius Vanderbilt,
Gerrit Smith, and seventeen other distinguished men of
the day. To the west of the square is old St. Paul's
Church, with the pews of Lee and Davis. It was while
attending service in this church, on Sunday, April 2,
1865, that Davis received Lee's telegram from Petersburg,
saying that Richmond must be evacuated. A
block or two west of the church, in East Franklin Street,
is a former residence of Lee. It was given by the late
Mrs. Joseph Bryan and her sisters to the Virginia Historical
Society, and is now, appropriately enough, the
home of that organization.</p>

<p>In the old drawing room, now the office of the Historical
Society, I found Mr. William G. Stanard, the corresponding
secretary, and from him heard something of
Lee's life there immediately after the War.</p>

<p>By the Northerners in Richmond at that time, including
the Federal troops stationed in the city, Lee was of
course respected and admired, while by the whole South
he was, and is to-day, adored. As for his own ex-soldiers,
they could not see him without emotion, and
because of the demonstrations which invariably attended
his appearance on the Richmond streets, he went out but
little, passing much time upon the back porch of the
house. Here most of the familiar Brady photographs
of him were taken. Brady sent a young photographer
to Richmond to get the photographs. Lee was at first
disposed to refuse to be taken, but his family persuaded
him to submit, on the ground that if there were any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
impertinence in the request it was not the fault of the
young man, and that the latter might lose his position if
he failed to obtain the desired pictures.</p>

<p>Finding the continued attention of the crowds too
much for him, the general left Richmond after two
months, removing to a small house in Cumberland
County, on the James, and it was there that he was residing
when called to the presidency of Washington College&mdash;now
Washington and Lee University&mdash;at Lexington,
Virginia. As is well known, he accepted this offer,
built up the institution, remained its president until the
time of his death, and now lies buried in the university
chapel.</p>

<p>To Mr. Stanard I am also indebted for the following
information regarding John Smith and Pocahontas:</p>

<p>About a mile below Richmond, in what is now the
brickyard region, there used to stand the residence of the
Mayo family, a place known as Powhatan. This place
has long been pointed out as the scene of the saving of
Smith by the Indian girl, but late research indicates
that, though Smith did come up the James to the present
site of Richmond, his capture by the Indians did not
occur here, but in the vicinity of Jamestown. Then Indians
took him first to one of their villages on York
River, near the present site of West Point, Virginia, and
thence to a place, on the same stream, in the county
of Gloucester, where the tribal chief resided. I was
under the impression that this worthy's name was Powhatan,
but Mr. Stanard declared "powhatan" was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a proper name, but an Indian word meaning "chief."</p>

<p>The Virginia Historical Society is satisfied that Smith
was rescued by Pocahontas at a point about nine miles
from Williamsburg on the west side of York River, but
there are historians who contend that the whole story
of the rescue is a fiction. One of these is Dr. Albert
Bushnell Hart, of Harvard, who lists Smith among
"Historical Liars." Virginians, who regard Smith as
one of their proudest historical possessions, are somewhat
disposed to resent this view, but it appears to me
that there is at least some ground for it. Matthew Page
Andrews, another historian, himself a Virginian, points
out that many of our ideas of the Jamestown colony have
been obtained from Smith's history of the settlement,
which he wrote in England, some years after leaving
Virginia.</p>

<p>"From these accounts," says Mr. Andrews, "we get
an unfavorable impression of Smith's associates in the
colony and of the management of the men composing the
popular or people's party in the London Company. As
we now know that this party in the London Company
was composed of very able and patriotic Englishmen, we
are inclined to think that Captain Smith not only overrated
his achievement, but was very unjust to his fellow-colonists
and the Company."</p>

<p>The story of the rescue of Smith by Pocahontas, with
the strong implication that the Indian girl was in love
with him, comes to us from Smith himself. We know
that when Pocahontas was nineteen years of age (seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
years after the Smith rescue is said to have occurred),
she married John Rolfe&mdash;the first Englishman to begin
the cultivation of the tobacco plant. We know that she
was taken to England, that she was welcomed at court
as a princess, that she had a son born in England, and
that she herself died there in 1617. We know also that
her son, Thomas Rolfe, settled in Virginia, and that
through him a number of Virginians trace descent from
Pocahontas. (Mr. Andrews points out that in 1915 one
of these descendants became the wife of the President of
the United States.)</p>

<p>But we know also that John Smith, brave and daring
though he was, was not above twisting and embroidering
a tale to his own glorification. While, therefore, it is
too much to affirm that his rescue story is false, it is well
to remember that Pocahontas was but twelve years old
when the rescue is said to have occurred, and that Smith
waited until after she had become famous, and had died,
to promulgate his romantic story.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Immediately to the north of Capitol Square stands the
City Hall, an ugly building, in the cellar of which is the
Police Court presided over by the celebrated and highly
entertaining Judge Crutchfield, otherwise known as "One
John" and "the Cadi"&mdash;of whom more presently. A
few blocks beyond the City Hall, in the old mansion at
the corner of East Clay and Twelfth Streets, which was
the "White House of the Confederacy," the official residence
of Jefferson Davis during the war, is the Confeder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ate
Museum&mdash;one of the most fascinating museums I
ever visited.</p>

<p>Not the least part of the charm of this museum is the
fact that it is not of great size, and that one may consequently
visit it without fatigue; but the chief fascination
of the place is the dramatic personalness of its exhibits.
To me there is always something peculiarly engaging
about intimate relics of historic figures, and it is
of such relics that the greater part of the collection of the
Confederate Museum consists. In one show case, for
example, are the saddle and bridle of General Lee, and
the uniform he wore when he surrendered. The effects
of General Joseph E. Johnston are shown in another
case, and in still another those of the picturesque J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.
Stuart, who, as here one may see, loved the little touch
of individuality and dash which came of wearing a
feather in a campaign hat. So also one learns something
of Stonewall Jackson when one sees in the cabinet,
along with his old blue hat and other possessions, the
gold spurs which were given to him by the ladies of
Baltimore, beside the steel spurs that he <i>wore</i>. All
Jackson's personal effects were very simple.</p>

<p>One of the most striking relics in the museum is the
Great Seal of the Confederacy, which was only returned
to Richmond within the last few years, after having been
lost track of for nearly half a century&mdash;a strange chapter

Confederate state papers purchased by the United States<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Government in 1872, of William J. Bromwell, formerly
a clerk in the Confederate State Department, brought to
light, a few years ago, the fact that the seal was in the
possession of Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N.,
retired.</p>

<p>At the time of the evacuation of Richmond, Bromwell
carried off a number of the Confederate state papers,
and Mrs. Bromwell took charge of the seal, transporting
it through the lines in her bustle. When later, through
Colonel John T. Pickett, Bromwell sold the papers to
the Government, Rear Admiral Selfridge&mdash;then a captain&mdash;was
the officer assigned to go to Hamilton, Ontario,
to inventory and receive them. It is said that
Pickett gave the seal to Selfridge at about this time,
first, however, having a duplicate made. This duplicate,
or a copy of it, was later offered for sale as the
original, but was found to be spurious. When examination
of the Pickett papers by Gaillard Hunt, of the Library
of Congress, finally traced the original seal to Rear
Admiral Selfridge, an effort was made to buy it back.
In 1912 three Richmond gentlemen, Messrs. Eppa Hunton,
Jr., William H. White and Thomas P. Bryan, purchased
the Seal of the admiral for three thousand dollars,
subject to proof of its authenticity. Mr. St. George
Bryan and Mr. William Gray, of Richmond, then took
the seal to London, where the makers are still well-known
engravers. Here, by means of hall marks, the
identification was made complete.</p>

<p>No less appealing than the relics of the deceased gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ernment
and great generals who are gone, are some of
the humbler items connected with the deaths of privates
in the ranks of North and South alike. One of the most
pathetic was a small daguerreotype of a beautiful young
girl. On a card, beside the picture, is the story of it,
so far as that story is ever likely to be known:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Picture found on the dead body of an unidentified Federal
soldier.</p>

<p>Presented by C.&nbsp;C. Calvert, Upperville, Va.</p></div>

<p>"We have always hoped," said Miss Susan B. Harrison,
house regent of the museum, "that some day
some one would come in and recognize this little picture,
and that it would find its way back to those who
ought to have it, and who might by this means at last
discover what became of the soldier who was dear to
them."</p>

<p>An even more tragic souvenir is a letter addressed to
A.&nbsp;V. Montgomery, Camden, Madison County, Mississippi,
in which a mortally wounded soldier of Confederacy
bids a last good-by to his father. The letter was
originally inclosed with one from Lieutenant Ethelbert
Fairfax, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., informing the father that his son
passed away soon after he had written. The text,
pitiful and heroic as it is, can give but the faintest idea
of the original, with its feeble, laborious writing, and the
dark-brown spots dappling the three sheets of paper
where blood from the boy's mangled shoulder dripped
upon them while he wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:</p>

<p>This is my last letter to you. I went into battle this evening
as courier for Gen'l Heth. I have been struck by a piece of shell
and my right shoulder is horribly mangled &amp; I know death is
inevitable. I am very weak but I write to you because I know
you would be delighted to read a word from your dying son. I
know death is near, that I will die far from home and friends
of my early youth, but I have friends here, too, who are kind
to me. My Friend Fairfax will write you at my request and
give you the particulars of my death. My grave will be marked
so that you may visit it if you desire to do so, but it is optionary
with you whether you let my remains rest here or in Mississippi.
I would like to rest in the graveyard with my dear
mother and brothers, but it is a matter of minor importance.
Let us all try to reunite in heaven. I pray my God to forgive
my sins &amp; I feel that his promises are true, that he will forgive
me and save me. Give my love to all my friends. My strength
fails me. My horse &amp; my equipments will be left for you.
Again a long farewell to you. May we meet in heaven.</p>

RANDOM RICHMOND NOTES</h2>


<p>Richmond may again be likened to Boston as
a literary center. In an article published some
years ago in "Book News" Alice M. Tyler refers
to Colonel William Byrd, who founded Richmond
in 1733, as the sprightliest and most genial native
American writer before Franklin. In the time of Chief
Justice Marshall, Richmond had a considerable group
of novelists, historians and essayists, but the great
literary name connected with the place is that of Edgar
Allan Poe, who spent much of his boyhood in the city
and later edited the "Southern Literary Messenger."
Matthew Fontaine Maury, the great scientist, mentioned
in an earlier chapter, was, at another time, editor of the
same periodical, as was also John Reuben Thompson,
"Poet of the Confederacy," who wrote, among other
poems, "Music in Camp," and who translated Gustave
Nadaud's familiar poem, "Carcassonne."</p>

<p>Thomas Nelson Page made his home in Richmond for
thirty years; Am&eacute;lie Rives was born there and still
maintains her residence in Albemarle County, Virginia,
while among other writers of the present time connected
with the city either by birth or long association are,
Henry Sydnor Harrison, Mary Johnston, Ellen Glas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>gow,
Marion Harland, Kate Langley Bosher, James
Branch Cabell, Edward Peple, dramatist, J.&nbsp;H. Whitty,
biographer of Poe, and Colonel W. Gordon McCabe, soldier,
historian, essayist, and local character&mdash;a gentleman
upon whose shoulders such imported expressions as
<i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, <i>bon viveur</i>, and <i>raconteur</i> alight as naturally
as doves on friendly shoulders.</p>

<p>Colonel McCabe is a link between present-day Richmond
and the traditions and associations of England.
He was the friend of Lord Roberts, he introduced Lord
Tennyson to Bull Durham tobacco, and, as is fitting
under the circumstances, he speaks and writes of a hotel
as "<i>an</i> hotel."</p>

<p>Henry Sydnor Harrison did his first writing as book
reviewer on the Richmond "Times-Dispatch," of which
paper he later became paragrapher and daily poet, and
still later editor in chief. It is commonly reported in
Richmond that the characters in his novel "Queed," the
scenes of which are laid in Richmond, were "drawn
from life." I asked Mr. Harrison about this.</p>

<p>"When the book appeared," he said, "I was much embarrassed
by the disposition of Richmond people&mdash;human
and natural, I suppose, when you 'know the author'&mdash;to
identify all the imaginary persons with various local
characters. Some characteristics of the political boss in
my story were in a degree suggested by a local celebrity;
Stewart Bryan is indicated, in passing, as Stewart
Byrd; and the bare bones of a historic case, altered at
will, were employed in another connection. But I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
I am stating the literal truth when I say that no figure
in the book is borrowed from life."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The recent residential development in Richmond has
been to the west of the city in the neighborhood of Monument
Avenue, a fine double drive, with a parked center,
lined with substantial new homes, and having at intervals
monuments to southern heroes: Lee, Davis, and
J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart.</p>

<p>The parks are on the outskirts of the city and, as in
most other cities, it is in these outlying regions that new
homes are springing up, thanks in no small degree to the
automobile. The Country Club of Virginia is out to
the west of the town, in what is known as Westhampton,
and is one of the most charming clubs of its kind
in the South or, indeed, in the country.</p>

</div>

<p>Richmond has one of the most beautiful and several
of the most curious cemeteries I have ever seen. Hollywood
Cemetery stands upon rolling bluffs overlooking
the James, and under its majestic trees are the tombs of
many famous men, including James Monroe, John Tyler,
Jefferson Davis and Fitzhugh Lee. An inscription on
the Davis monument, which was erected by the widow
and daughter of the President of the Confederacy, describes
him as "an American soldier and defender of the
Constitution." At the back of the pedestal is another
inscription:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p class='center'>
<span class="smcap">President of the Confederate
States of America 1861-1865.<br />
Faithful to All Trusts, a Martyr
to Principle.<br />
He Lived and Died the Most
Consistent of American Soldiers
and Statesmen.</span>
</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that, instead of having monuments
because in life they were famous, men are made
famous after death, by the inscriptions placed upon their
tombstones. Such is the case with James E. Valentine,
a locomotive engineer killed in a collision many years
ago. The Valentine monument in Hollywood Cemetery
is almost as well known as the monuments erected in
memory of the great, the reason for this being embodied
in the following verse adorning the stone:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Until the brakes are turned on Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's throttle valve shut down,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In the burial ground of old St. John's Church&mdash;the
building in which Patrick Henry delivered his "Give me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Liberty or give me Death" oration&mdash;are a number of old
gravestones bearing strange inscriptions which appeal
to the imagination, and also, alas! elicit sad thoughts
concerning those who wrote the old-time gravestone
doggerel.</p>

<p>The custodian of the church is glad to indicate the interesting
stones, but is much more taken up with his own
gift of oratory, as displayed when, on getting visitors
inside the church, he takes his place on the spot where
Patrick Henry stood, and delivers the famous oration.
Having done this to us&mdash;or perhaps it would seem more
generous to say <i>for</i> us&mdash;the caretaker told us that many
persons who had heard him had declared that Patrick
Henry himself would have had a hard time doing it
better. But when he threatened, for contrast, to deliver
the oration as a less gifted elocutionist might speak
it, my companion, in whom I had already observed signs
of restlessness, interrupted with the statement that we
were late for an engagement, and fled from the place,
followed by me.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In certain parts of the city, often at a considerable
distance from the warehouse and factory sections, one
may occasionally catch upon the breeze the faint, spicy
fragrance of tobacco; and should one trace these pleasant
scents to their sources, one would come to a region
of factories in which rich brown leaves are transformed
into pipe tobacco, plug tobacco, or cigarettes. In the
simpler processes of this work, negro men and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
are employed, and these with their natural picturesqueness
of pose and costume, and their singing, in the setting
of an old shadowy loft, make a tobacco factory a
fascinating place. In one loft you will see negro men
and boys handling the tobacco leaves with pitchforks,
much as farm hands handle hay; in another, negro
women squatting upon boxes, stemming the leaves, or
"pulling up ends," their black faces blending mysteriously
with the dark shadows of beams and rafters.
Here the air is laden not only with the sweet tobacco
smell, mixed with a faint scent of licorice and of fruit,
but is freighted also with a fine brown dust which is
revealed where bars of sunlight strike in through the
windows, and which seems, as it shifts and sparkles, to
be a visible expression of the smell.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Negro women squatting upon boxes in old shadowy lofts stem the tobacco leaves</span>
</div>

<p>In the busy season "street niggers" are generally used
for stemming, which is, perhaps, the leading part of the
tobacco industry in Richmond, and these "street niggers,"
a wild yet childlike lot, who lead a hand-to-mouth
existence all year round, bring to the tobacco trade a
wealth of semi-barbaric color. To give us an idea of the
character of a Richmond "street nigger" the gentleman
who took my companion and me through the factory told
us of having wanted a piece of light work done, and
having asked one of these negroes: "Want to earn a
quarter?"</p>

<p>To which the latter replied without moving from his
comfortable place beside a sun-baked brick wall: "No,
boss, Ah <i>got</i> a quahtah."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>The singing of the negroes is a great feature of the
stemming department in a tobacco factory. Some of
the singers become locally famous; also, I was told by
the superintendent, they become independent, and for
that reason have frequently to be dismissed. The wonderful
part of this singing, aside from the fascinating
harmonies made by the sweet, untrained negro voices,
is the utter lack of prearrangement that there is about
it. Now there will be silence in the loft; then there will
come a strange, half-savage cry from some dark corner,
musical, yet seemingly meaningless; soon a faint
humming will begin, and will be taken up by men and
women all over the loft; the humming will swell into a
chant to which the workers rock as their black hands
travel swiftly among the brown leaves; then, presently,
it will die away, and there will be silence until they
are again moved to song.</p>

<p>From shadowy room to shadowy room, past great
dark bins filled with the leaves, past big black steaming
vats, oozing sweet-smelling substances, past moist fragrant
barrels, always among the almost spectral forms
of negroes, treading out leaves with bare feet, working
over great wicker baskets stained to tobacco color, piling
up wooden frames, or operating the powerful hydraulic
presses which convert the soft tobacco into plugs of concrete
hardness&mdash;so one goes on through the factory.
The browns and blacks of these interiors are the browns
and blacks of etchings; the color of the leaves, the old
dark timbers, the black faces and hands, and the ragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
clothing, combined with the humming of negro voices,
the tobacco fragrance, and the golden dust upon the
air, make an indescribably complete harmony of shade,
sound, and scent.</p>

<p>The department in which the pipe tobacco is packed
in tins is a very different sort of place; here white labor
is employed: a great many girls seated side by side at
benches working with great digital dexterity: measuring
out the tobacco, folding wax paper cartons, filling
them, and slipping them into the narrow tins, all at a
rate of speed so great as to defy the sight, giving a sense
of fingers flickering above the bench with a strange,
almost supernatural sureness, like the fingers of a
magician who makes things disappear before your eyes;
or like the pictures in which post-impressionist and
cubist painters attempt to express motion.</p>

<p>"May I speak to one of them?" I asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Sure," said he.</p>

<p>I went up to a young woman who was working, if
anything, more rapidly than the other girls at the same
bench.</p>

<p>"Can you think, while you are doing this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, without looking up, while her
fingers flashed on ceaselessly.</p>

<p>"About other things?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How many cans do you fill in a day?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"About thirty-four to thirty-five hundred on the average."</p>

<p>"May I ask your name?" She gave it.</p>

<p>I took up one of the small identification slips which
she put into each package, and wrote her name upon the
back of it. The number on the slip&mdash;for the purpose of
identifying the girl who packed the tin&mdash;was 220. Let
the reader, therefore, be informed that if he smokes
Edgeworth Ready Rubbed, and finds in a tin a slip
bearing that number, he has been served by no less a
person than Miss Katie Wise, of the astonishingly speedy
fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>My companion and I had not traveled far into
the South before we discovered that our comfort
was likely to be considerably enhanced if,
in hotels, we singled out an intelligent bell boy and, as
far as possible, let this one boy serve us. Our mainstay
in the Jefferson Hotel was Charles Jackson, No. 144,
or, when Charles was "off," his "side partner," whom
we knew as Bob.</p>

<p>Having one day noticed a negro in convict's stripes,
but without a guard, raking up leaves in Capitol Square,
I asked Charles about the matter.</p>

<p>"Do they let the convicts go around unguarded?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"They 's some of 'em can," said he. "Those is
trustees."</p>

<p>This talk of "trustees" led to other things and finally
to a strong recommendation, by Charles, of the Richmond
Police Court, as a place of entertainment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it interesting?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Inter-<i>resting</i>? Yes, <i>suh</i>! Judge Crutchfield he
suttinly <i>is</i>. He done chahge me twenty-six dollahs and
fo'ty cents. My brothah, he got in fight down street,
heah. Some niggers set on him. I went to he'p him
an' p'leeceman got me. He say I was resistin' p'leece.
I ain't resisted no p'leece! No, <i>suh</i>! Not <i>me</i>! But
Judge Crutchfield, you can't tell him nothin'. 'Tain't

don't want no lawyers in his co't. Like 's not he cha'ge

<p>"Billy, he say: 'Git on out heah, niggah! Ain't no

<p>"Othah niggah, he say: 'Don't make no diff'unce

Yes, <i>suh</i>! 'at 's a way Judge Crutchfield is. Can't tell

'Pfst! Five dollahs!'&mdash;'Pfst! Ten dollahs!'&mdash;'Pfst!
Fifteen dollahs!'&mdash;just how he feel. He suttinly is
some judge, 'at man."</p>

<p>Encouraged by this account of police court justice as
meted out to the Richmond negro, my companion and I
did visit Justice Crutchfield's court.</p>

<p>The room in the basement of the City Hall was
crowded. All the benches were occupied and many persons,
white and black, were standing up. Among the
members of the audience&mdash;for the performance is more
like a vaudeville show with the judge as headliner than
like a serious tribunal&mdash;I noticed several actors and actresses
from a company which was playing in Richmond
at the time&mdash;these doubtless drawn to the place by the
fact that Walter C. Kelly, billed in vaudeville as "The
Virginia Judge," is commonly reported to have taken
Judge Crutchfield as a model for his exceedingly amusing
monologue. Mr. Kelly himself has, however, told
me that his inspiration came from hearing the late Judge
J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;G. Brown, of Newport News, hold court.</p>

<p>At the back of the room, in what appeared to be a sort
of steel cage, were assembled the prisoners, all of them,
on this occasion, negroes; while at the head of the chamber
behind the usual police-court bulwark, sat the judge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>&mdash;a
white-haired, hook-nosed man of more than seventy,
peering over the top of his eyeglasses with a look of
shrewd, merciless divination.</p>

<p>"William Taylor!" calls a court officer.</p>

<p>A negro is brought from the cage to the bar of
justice. He is a sad spectacle, his face adorned with
a long strip of surgeon's plaster. The judge looks at
him over his glasses. The hearing proceeds as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Officer</span> (to prisoner)&mdash;Get over there!
(Prisoner obeys.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Crutchfield</span>&mdash;Sunday drunk&mdash;Five dollars.</p>

<p>It is over.</p>

<p>The next prisoner is already on his way to the bar.
He is a short, wide negro, very black and tattered. A
large black negress, evidently his consort, arises as witness
against him. The case goes as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Crutchfield</span>&mdash;Drunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wife</span> (looking contemptuously at her spouse)&mdash;Drunk?

<br />
NORFOLK AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>


<p>Just as New York looks newer than Boston, but
is actually older, Norfolk looks newer than Richmond.
Business and population grow in Richmond,
but you do not feel them growing as you do in
Norfolk. You feel that Richmond business men already
have money, whereas in Norfolk there is less old wealth
and a great deal more scrambling for new dollars. Also
you feel that law and order count for more in Richmond
than in Norfolk, and that the strict prohibition law which
not long ago became effective in Virginia will be more
easily enforced in the capital than in the seaport. Norfolk,
in short, likes the things New York likes. It likes
tall office buildings, and it dotes on the signs of commercial
activity by day and social activity by night.
Furthermore, from the tops of some of the high buildings
the place actually looks like a miniature New York:
the Elizabeth River masquerading as the East River;
Portsmouth, with its navy yard, pretending to be Brooklyn,
while some old-time New York ferryboats, running
between the two cities, assist in completing the illusion.
In the neighboring city of Newport News, Norfolk has
its equivalent for Jersey City and Hoboken, while Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>oughby
Spit protrudes into Hampton Roads like Sandy
Hook reduced to miniature.</p>

<span class="caption">Some genuine old-time New York ferryboats help to complete the illusion that Norfolk is New York</span>
</div>

<p>The principal shopping streets of Norfolk and Richmond
are as unlike as possible. Broad Street, Richmond,
is very wide, and is never overcrowded, whereas
Granby Street, Norfolk (advertised by local enthusiasts
as "the livest street in Virginia," and appropriately
spanned, at close intervals, by arches of incandescent
lights), is none too wide for the traffic it carries, with
the result that, during the afternoon and evening, it is
truly very much alive. To look upon it at the crowded
hours is to get a suggestion of a much larger city than
Norfolk actually is&mdash;a suggestion which is in part accounted
for by the fact that Norfolk's spending population,
drawn from surrounding towns and cities, is much
greater than the number of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Norfolk's extraordinary growth in the last two or
three decades may be traced to several causes: to the
fertility of the soil of the surrounding region, which,
intensively cultivated, produces rich market-garden
crops, making Norfolk a great shipping point for
"truck"; to the development of the trade in peanuts,
which are grown in large quantities in this corner of
Virginia; to a great trade in oysters and other sea-food,
and to the continually increasing importance of the
Norfolk navy yard.</p>

<p>In connection with the navy Norfolk has always
figured prominently, Hampton Roads having been a
favorite naval rendezvous since the early days of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
American fleet. Now, however, it is announced that
the cry of our navy for a real naval base&mdash;something we
have never had, though all other important navies have
them, Britain alone having three&mdash;has been heard in
Washington, and that Norfolk has been selected as the
site for a base. This is an important event not only for
the Virginia seaport, but for the United States.</p>

<p>Farmers who think they are in a poor business will do
well to investigate Norfolk's recent history. The
"trucking" industry of Norfolk is said to amount in the
aggregate to twelve or fourteen million dollars annually,
and many fortunes have been made from it. The
pioneer "trucker" of the region was Mr. Richard Cox.
A good many years ago Mr. Cox employed a German
boy, a blacksmith by trade, named Henry Kern. Kern
finally branched out for himself. When, in 1915, he
died, his real estate holdings in Norfolk and Portsmouth
were valued at two million dollars, all of which had been
made from garden truck. He was but one of a considerable
class of wealthy men whose fortunes have sprung
from the same source.</p>

<p>Many of the truck farms have access to the water.
The farmers bring their produce to the city in their own
boats, giving the port a picturesque note. At Norfolk it
is transferred to steamers which carry it to New York,
Philadelphia, Boston, Providence, Baltimore and Washington.
Lately a considerable amount of truck has
been shipped west by rail, as well.</p>

<p>Hundreds of acres of ground in the vicinity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
city are under glass and large crops of winter vegetables
are raised. Kale and spinach are being grown and harvested
throughout the cold months; strawberries, potatoes,
beans, peas, cucumbers, cabbage, lettuce and other
vegetables follow through the spring and summer, running
on into the fall, when the corn crop becomes important.
Corn is raised chiefly by the peanut farmer,
whose peanuts grow between his corn-rows.</p>

<p>While the banks are "carrying" the peanut farmers,
pending their fall harvest, the activities of the "truckers"
are at their height, so that the money loaned to one
class of agriculturist is replaced by the deposits of the
other class; and by the same token, of course, the peanut
farmers are depositing money in the banks when the
"truckers" want to borrow. This situation, one judges,
is not found objectionable by Norfolk and Portsmouth
bankers, and I have been told that, as a corollary, these
banks have never been forced, even in times of dire
panic, to issue clearing house certificates, but have always
paid cash.</p>

<p>Norfolk has grown so fast and has so rapidly replaced
the old with the new, that the visitor must keep his eyes
open if he would not miss entirely such lovely souvenirs
of an earlier and easier life, as still remain. Who would
imagine, seeing it to-day, that busy Granby Street had
ever been a street of fine residences? Yet a very few
years have passed since the old Newton, Tazwell, Dickson
and Taylor residences surrendered to advancing
commerce and gave place to stores and office buildings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>&mdash;the
two last mentioned having been replaced by the Dickson
Building and the Taylor Building, erected less than
fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>Freemason Street is the highway which, more
than any other, tells of olden times. For though the
downtown end of this lovely old thoroughfare has lapsed
into decay, many beautiful mansions, dating from long
ago, are to be seen a few blocks out from the busier
portion of the city. Among these should be mentioned
the Whittle house, the H.&nbsp;N. Castle house, and particularly
the exquisite ivy-covered residence of Mr. Barton
Myers, at the corner of Bank Street. The city of Norfolk
ought, I think, to attempt to acquire this house and
preserve it (using it perhaps as a memorial museum to
contain historical relics) to show what has been, in Norfolk,
as against what is, and to preach a silent sermon on
the high estate of beauty from which a fine old city may
fall, in the name of progress and commercial growth.</p>

<p>To the credit of Norfolk be it said that old St. Paul's
Church, with its picturesque churchyard and tombs, is
excellently cared for and properly valued as a pre-Revolutionary
relic. The church was built in 1730, and
was struck by a British cannon-ball when Lord Dunmore
bombarded the place in 1776. Baedeker tells me, however,
that the cannon-ball now resting in the indentation
in the wall of the church is "not the original."</p>

<p>When I say that St. Paul's is properly valued I mean
that many citizens told my companion and me to be sure
to visit. I observe, however&mdash;and I take it as a sign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of the times in Norfolk&mdash;that an extensive, well-printed
and much illustrated book on Norfolk, issued by the
Chamber of Commerce, contains pictures of banks,
docks, breweries, mills, office buildings, truck farms, peanut
farms, battleships, clubhouses, hotels, hospitals, factories,
and innumerable new residences, but no picture
of the church, or of the lovely old homes of Freemason
Street. Nor do I find in the booklet any mention of the
history of the city or the surrounding region&mdash;although
that region includes places of the greatest beauty and
interest: among them the glorious old manor houses of
the James River; the ancient and charming town of
Williamsburg, second capital of the Virginia colony, and
seat of William and Mary College, the oldest college in
the United States excepting Harvard; Yorktown,
"Waterloo of the Revolution"; many important battlefields
of the Civil War; Hampton Institute, the famous
negro industrial school at Hampton, nearby; the lovely
stretch of water on which the <i>Monitor</i> met the <i>Merrimac</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
the site of the first English settlement in America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
at Jamestown, and, for mystery and desolation, the
Dismal Swamp with Lake Drummond at its heart. But
then, I suppose it is natural that the Chamber of Commerce
mind should thrust aside such things in favor of
the mighty "goober," which is a thing of to-day, a thing
for which Norfolk is said to be the greatest of all markets.
For is not history dead, and is not the man who
made a fortune out of a device for shelling peanuts without
causing the nuts to drop in two, still living?</p>

<p>And yet the modernness on which Norfolk so evidently
prides herself is not something to be lightly valued.
Fine schools, fine churches and miles of pleasant, recently
built homes are things for any American city to rejoice
in. Therefore Norfolk rejoices in Ghent, her chief
modern residence district, which is penetrated by arms
of the Elizabeth River, so that many of the houses in
this part of the city look out upon pretty lagoons, dotted
over with all manner of pleasure craft. Less than
twenty years ago, the whole of what is now Ghent was a
farm, and there are other suburban settlements, such as
Edgewater, Larchmont, Winona and Lochhaven, out in
the direction of Hampton Roads, which have grown up
in the last six or eight years. The Country Club of
Norfolk, with a very pleasing club-house on the water,
and an eighteen-hole golf course, is at Lochhaven, and
the new naval base is, I believe, to be located somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
farther out, on the site of the Jamestown Exposition.</p>

<p>Norfolk is well provided with nearby seaside recreation
places, of which probably the most attractive is
Virginia Beach, facing the ocean. Ocean View, so
called, is on Chesapeake Bay, and there are summer cottage
colonies at Willoughby Spit and Cape Henry. On
the bay side of Cape Henry is Lynnhaven Inlet connecting
Lynnhaven Bay and River with Chesapeake Bay.
From Lynnhaven Bay come the famous oysters of that
name, now to be had in most of the large cities of the
East, but which seemed to me to taste a little better at
the Virginia Club, in Norfolk, than oysters ever tasted
anywhere. Perhaps that was because they were real
Lynnhavens, just as the Virginia Club's Smithfield ham
is real Smithfield ham from the little town of Smithfield,
Virginia, a few miles distant. On the bank of the
Lynnhaven River is situated the Old Donation farm with
a ruined church, and an ancient dwelling house which
was used as the first courthouse in Princess Anne
County; and not far distant from this place is Witch
Duck Point, where Grace Sherwood, after having been
three times tried, and finally convicted as a witch, was
thrown into the river.</p>

<p>The several waterside places I have mentioned are
more or less local in character, but there is nothing local
about Fortress Monroe, on Old Point Comfort, just
across Hampton Roads, which has for many years been
one of the most beautiful and highly individualized idling
places on the Atlantic Coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The old moated fortress, the interior of which is more
like some lovely garden of the last century than a military
post, remains an important coast artillery station, and is
a no less lovely spot now than when our grandparents
went there on their wedding journeys, stopping at the
old Hygiea Hotel, long since gone the way of old hotels.</p>

<p>The huge Chamberlin Hotel, however, remains apparently
unchanged, and is to-day as spacious, comfortable
and homelike as when our fathers and mothers, or
perhaps we ourselves, stopped there years ago. The
Chamberlin, indeed, seems to have the gift of perennial
youth. I remember a ball which was given there in
honor of Admiral Sampson and the officers of his fleet,
after the Spanish War. The ballroom was so full of
naval and military uniforms that I, in my somber civilian
clothing, felt wan and lonely. Most of the evening I
passed in modest retirement, looking out upon the brilliant
scene from behind a potted palm. And yet, when
my companion and I, now in our dotage, recently visited
the Chamberlin, there stood the same potted palm in the
same place. Or if it was not the same, it was one
exactly like it.</p>

<p>The Chamberlin is of course a great headquarters for
army and navy people, and we observed, moreover, that
honeymooning couples continue to infest it&mdash;for Fortress
Monroe has long ranked with Washington and
Niagara Falls as a scene to be visited upon the wedding
journey.</p>

<p>There they all were, as of old: the young husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
scowling behind his newspaper and pretending to read
and not to be thinking of his pretty little wife across the
breakfast table; the fat blonde bride being continually
photographed by her adoring mate&mdash;now leaning against
a pile on the pier, now seated on a wall, with her feet
crossed, now standing under a live-oak within the fortress;
also there was the inevitable young pair who
simply couldn't keep their hands off from each other; we
came upon them constantly&mdash;in the sun-parlor, where
she would be seated on the arm of his chair, running her
hand through his hair; wandering in the eventide
along the shore, with arms about each other, or going in
to meals, she leading him down the long corridor by his
"ickle finger".</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I recall that it was as we were going back to Norfolk
from Old Point Comfort, having dinner on a most excellent
large steamer, running to Norfolk and Cape Charles,
that my companion remarked to me, out of a clear sky,
that he had made up his mind, once for all, that, come
what might, he would never, never, never get married.
No, never!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Though I had often heard, before going into
the South, of the devotion of that section to
the memory of General Robert E. Lee, I never
fully realized the extent of that devotion until I began to
become a little bit acquainted with Virginia. I remember
being struck, while in Norfolk, with the fact that
portraits of General Lee were to be seen in many offices
and homes, much as one might expect, at the present
time, to find portraits of Joffre and Nivelle in the homes
of France, or of Haig in the homes of Britain. It is not
enough to say that the memory of Lee is to the South
like that of Napoleon I to France, for it is more. The
feeling of France for Napoleon is one of admiration, of
delight in a national military genius, of hero-worship,
but there is not intermingled with it the quality of pure
affection which fully justifies the use of the word <i>love</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
in characterizing the feeling of the South for its great
military leader&mdash;the man of whom Lord Wolseley said:
"He was a being apart and superior to all others in every
way; a man with whom none I ever knew, and very few
of whom I ever read are worthy to be compared; a man
who was cast in a grander mould and made of finer
metal than all other men."</p>

<p>Nor is this love surprising, for whereas Napoleon was
a self-seeking man, and one whose personal character
was not altogether admirable in other respects, and
whereas he could hardly be said to typify France's ideal
of everything a gentleman should be, Lee sought nothing
for himself, was a man of great nobility of character,
and was in perfection a Virginia gentleman. At the
end, moreover, where Napoleon's defeat was that of an
aspirant to conquest, glory and empire, Lee's defeat was
that of a cause, and the cause was regarded in the entire
South as almost holy, so that, in defeat, the South felt
itself martyred, and came to look upon its great general
with a love and veneration unequaled in history, and
much more resembling the feeling of France for the
canonized Joan of Arc, than for the ambitious Corsican.</p>

<p>When, therefore, my companion and I heard, while in
Norfolk, that Colonel Walter H. Taylor, president of
the Marine Bank of that city, had served through the
Civil War on General Lee's staff, we naturally became
very anxious to meet him; and I am glad to say that
Colonel Taylor, though at the time indisposed and confined
to his home, was so kind as to receive us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>He was seated in a large chair in his library, on the
second floor of his residence, a pleasant old-fashioned
brick house at the corner of York and Yarmouth Streets&mdash;a
slender man, not very tall, I judged (though I did
not see him standing), not very strong at the moment,
but with nothing of the decrepitude of old age about
him, for all his seventy-seven years. Upon the contrary
he was, in appearance and manner, delightfully alert,
with the sort of alertness which lends to some men and
women, regardless of their years, a suggestion of perpetual
youthfulness. Such alertness, in those who have
lived a long time, is most often the result of persistent
intellectual activity, and the sign of it is usually to be
read in the eyes. Colonel Taylor's keen, dark, observant,
yet kindly eyes, were perhaps his finest feature,
though, indeed, all his features were fine, and his head,
with its well-trimmed white hair and mustache, was one
of great distinction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor (of whom we had previously been warned
to beware, because she had not yet forgiven the "Yankees"
for their sins) was also present: a beautiful old
lady of unquenchable spirit, in whose manner, though
she received us with politeness, we detected lurking
danger.</p>

<p>And why not? Do not women remember some things
longer than men remember them? Do not the sweethearts
who stayed at home remember the continual dull
dread they suffered while the men they loved faced
danger, whereas the absent lovers were at least in part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
compensated for the risks they ran, by the continual
sense of high adventure and achievement?</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor was Miss Elizabeth Selden Saunders,
daughter of Captain John L. Saunders of Virginia, who
died in 1860, in the service of his country, a commander
in the United States Navy. When the war broke out
Miss Saunders, wishing to serve the Confederate Government,
became a clerk in the Surgeon General's office,
at Richmond, and there she remained while Colonel
Taylor, whose training at the Virginia Military Institute,
coupled with his native ability, made him valuable
as an officer, followed the fortunes of General Lee, part
of the time as the general's aide-de-camp, and the rest
of the time as adjutant-general and chief of staff of the
Army of Northern Virginia, in which capacities he was
present at all general engagements of the army, under
Lee.</p>

<p>On April 2, 1865, when Lee's gallant but fast dwindling
army, short of supplies, and so reduced in numbers
as to be no longer able to stand against the powerful
forces of Grant, was evacuating its lines at Petersburg,
when it was evident that the capital of the Confederacy
was about to fall, and the orders for retreat had been
despatched by Colonel Taylor, in his capacity as adjutant&mdash;then
the colonel went to his commander and asked for
leave of absence over night, for the purpose of going to
Richmond and being married. He tells the story in his
exceedingly interesting and valuable book, "General Lee&mdash;His
Campaigns in Virginia":<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the close of the day's work, when all was in readiness for
the evacuation of our lines under cover of the darkness of night,
I asked permission of General Lee to ride over to Richmond and
to rejoin him early the next morning, telling him that my mother
and sisters were in Richmond and that I would like to say
good-by to them, and that my sweetheart was there, and we had
arranged, if practicable, to be married that night. He expressed
some surprise at my entertaining such a purpose at that time,
but when I explained to him that the home of my bride-elect was
in the enemy's lines, that she was alone in Richmond and employed
in one of the departments of the government, and wished
to follow the fortunes of the Confederacy should our lines be re&euml;stablished
farther South, he promptly gave his assent to my
plans. I galloped to the railroad station, then at Dunlops, on the
north side of the river, where I found a locomotive and several
cars, constituting the "ambulance train," designed to carry to
Richmond the last of the wounded of our army requiring hospital
treatment. I asked the agent if he had another engine, when,
pointing to one rapidly receding in the direction of Richmond, he
replied, "Yonder goes the only locomotive we have besides the
one attached to this train." Turning my horse over to the courier
who accompanied me, with directions to join me in Richmond as
soon as he could, I mounted the locomotive in waiting, directed
the engineer to detach it from the cars and to proceed to overtake
the engine ahead of us. It was what the sailors call a stern chase
and a long one. We did not overtake the other locomotive until
it had reached Falling Creek, about three-fourths of the distance,
when I transferred to it and sent the other back to Petersburg.
I reached Richmond without further incident, and soon after
midnight I was married to Elizabeth Selden Saunders.... As
will be readily understood, the occasion was not one of great
hilarity, though I was very happy; my eyes were the only dry ones
in the company....</p>

<p>The people of Richmond were greatly excited and in despair
in the contemplation of the abandonment of their beautiful city
by our troops. General Lee had for so long a time thwarted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the designs of his powerful adversaries for the capture of the
city, and seemed so unfailing and resourceful in his efforts to
hold them at bay, that the good people found it difficult to realize
that he was compelled at last to give way. There was universal
gloom and despair at the thought that at the next rising of the
sun the detested Federal soldiers would take possession of the
city and occupy its streets. The transportation companies were
busily engaged in arranging for the removal of the public stores
and of the archives of the government. A fire in the lower part
of the city was fiercely raging, and added greatly to the excitement.</p>

<p>Somewhere near four o'clock on the morning of the 3d of
April I bade farewell to all my dear ones, and in company with
my brother-in-law, Colonel John S. Saunders, proceeded toward
Mayo's Bridge, which we crossed to the south side of the James,
in the lurid glare of the fire, and within the sound of several
heavy explosions that we took to be the final scene in the career of
the Confederate navy, then disappearing in smoke on the James
River, near Rockets.</p></div>

<p>Before we departed from the colonel's library, which
we felt obliged to do much sooner than we wished to,
owing to the condition of his health, he called our attention
to an oil portrait of his old commander, which occupied
the place of honor above the mantelpiece, and asked
his daughters to let us see his scrap-book, containing
personal letters from General Lee, Jefferson Davis, and
other distinguished men, as well as various war documents
of unusual interest.</p>

<p>We felt it a great privilege to handle these old letters
and to read them, and the charm of them was the greater
for the affection in which the general held Colonel Taylor,
as evidenced by the tone in which he wrote. To us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
it was a wonderful evening.... And it still seems to
me wonderful to think that I have met and talked with
a man who issued Lee's orders, who rode forth with Lee
when he went to meet Grant in conference at Appomattox,
just before the surrender, who once slept under the
same blanket with Lee, who knew Lee as well perhaps
as one man can know another, and under conditions calculated
to try men to the utmost.</p>

<p>As adjutant, Colonel Taylor took an active part in
arranging details of surrender and parole. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Each officer and soldier was furnished for his protection from
arrest or annoyance with a slip of paper containing his parole,
signed by his commander and countersigned by an officer of the
Federal army.</p>

<p>I signed these paroles for all members of the staff, and when
my own case was reached I requested General Lee to sign mine,
which I have retained to the present time.</p></div>

<p>This document, with Colonel Taylor's name and title
in his own handwriting, and the signature of General
Lee, I am able to reproduce here through the courtesy
of the colonel's daughters, Mrs. William B. Baldwin
and Miss Taylor, of Norfolk. It is the only parole
which was signed personally by General Lee.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>On the back of the little slip, which is of about the
size of a bank check, is the countersignature of George
H. Sharpe, Assistant Provost Marshal general:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/277.png" width="390" height="237" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Following his parole Colonel Taylor rode with General
Lee to Richmond. The general seemed to be in a
philosophical frame of mind, but thought much of the future.
The subject of the surrender and its consequences
was about exhausted. The Colonel tells of one incident:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the route General Lee stopped for the night near the residence
of his brother, Mr. Carter Lee, in Powhatan County; and
although importuned by his brother to pass the night under his
roof, the general persisted in pitching his tent by the side of the
road and going into camp as usual. This continued self-denial
can only be explained upon the hypothesis that he desired to have
his men know that he shared their privations to the very last.</p></div>

<p>This was perfectly in character with Lee. Throughout
the War, we learn from Colonel Taylor's book, the
general used the army ration, and lived the army life.
He would not take up his quarters in a house, because
he wished to share the lot of his men, and also because
he feared that, in the event of the house falling into the
hands of the enemy, the very fact of its having been
occupied by him might possibly cause its destruction. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
was only during the last year of the War, when his
health was somewhat impaired, that he consented sometimes
to vary this rule.</p>

<p>Lee's chivalrous nature is well shown forth in his
famous General Orders, No. 73, issued at Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania, a few days before Gettysburg.</p>

<p>After congratulating the troops on their good conduct
the general continued as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness on the
part of some that they have in keeping the yet unsullied reputation
of the army, and that the duties exacted of us by civilization and
Christianity are not less obligatory in the country of the enemy
than in our own.</p>

<p>The commanding general considers that no greater disgrace
could befall the army, and through it our whole people, than the
perpetration of the barbarous outrages upon the unarmed and
defenseless, and the wanton destruction of private property, that
have marked the course of the enemy in our own country.</p>

<p>Such proceedings not only degrade the perpetrators and all
connected with them, but are subversive to the discipline and efficiency
of the army, and destructive of the ends of our present
movement. It must be remembered that we make war only upon
armed men, and that we cannot take vengeance for the wrongs
our people have suffered without lowering ourselves in the eyes
of all whose abhorrence has been excited by the atrocities of our
enemies, and offending against Him to whom vengeance belongeth,
without whose favor and support our efforts must all prove
in vain. The commanding general, therefore, earnestly exhorts
the troops to abstain with most scrupulous care from unnecessary
or wanton injury to private property, and he enjoins upon all
officers to arrest and bring to summary punishment all who shall
in any way offend against the orders on this subject.</p>

<p>Truly, a document to serve as a model for warriors
of all future generations, albeit one showing an utter
lack of "Kultur"!</p>

<p>Said Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts: "I
doubt if a hostile force ever advanced into an enemy's
country, or fell back from it in retreat, leaving behind
it less cause of hate and bitterness than did the Army
of Northern Virginia in that memorable campaign."</p>

<p>After the war, Colonel Taylor and his wife settled in
Norfolk, where, within a very short time, a United
States grand jury indicted Jefferson Davis and General
Lee for treason&mdash;this, in the case of Lee, being in direct
violation of the terms of surrender. When Grant
learned of the shameful action of the grand jury he complained
to Washington and caused the proceedings
against Lee to be dropped.</p>

<p>In Colonel Taylor's scrap-book I found a letter written
by Lee before the indictment had been quashed, referring
to the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Richmond, Va.<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">June 17, 1865.</span></p>

<p>My dear Colonel:</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for your letter of the 13th. I
had heard of the indictment by the grand jury at Norfolk, and
made up my mind to let the authorities take their course. I have
no wish to avoid any trial the government may order, and cannot
flee. I hope others may be unmolested, and that you at least may
be undisturbed.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that our returned soldiers cannot obtain
employment. Tell them they must all set to work, and if they
cannot do what they prefer, do what they can. Virginia wants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
all their aid, all their support, and the presence of all her sons
to sustain and recuperate her. They must therefore put themselves
in a position to take part in her government, and not be
deterred by obstacles in their way. There is much to be done
which they only can do.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 4em;">R.&nbsp;E. Lee.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>As time went on, and the more gaping wounds began
to heal, Colonel Taylor's letters from the general took
in many cases a lighter and happier tone. After some
years, when four daughters had been born to Colonel and
Mrs. Taylor, while yet they had no son, the general
chaffed them gently on the subject: "Give my congratulations
to Mrs. Taylor," he wrote. "Tell her I hope
that when her fancy for girls is satisfied (mine is exorbitant)
she will begin upon the boys. We must have
somebody to work for them."</p>

<p>One of the colonel's sons was present when I came
upon this letter.</p>

<p>"And you see," he smiled, "my father obeyed his old
commander to the last, for the next baby was a boy, and
the next, and the next, and the next, until there were
as many boys as girls in our family."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Colonel Taylor died at his home in Norfolk, March 1,
1916, and on the subsequent June 15, was followed by
his wife.</p>

<p>His death leaves but three members of Lee's staff
surviving, namely, Rev. Giles B. Cooke, of Portsmouth,
Virginia, Inspector General; Major Henry E. Young,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of Charleston, South Carolina, Judge Advocate General;
and Colonel T.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;R. Talcott, of Richmond, Virginia,
Aide-de-Camp. Of these officers only the first
two surrendered with General Lee, Colonel Talcott having
left the staff by promotion in 1863.</p>

<p>Yes, two of them surrendered, but if we are to believe
Charles Francis Adams we cannot say that Lee
and his forces were actually vanquished, for as the Massachusetts
soldier-author put it:</p>

<p>"Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia never sustained
defeat. Finally succumbing to exhaustion, to
the end they were not overthrown in fight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as it is the fashion in the Middle West to
speak jestingly of Kansas, it is the fashion in the
South to treat lightly the State of North Carolina.
And just as my companion and I, long ago, on another
voyage of discovery, were eager to get into Kansas and
find out what that fabulous Commonwealth was really
like, so we became anxious, as we heard the gossip about
the "Old North State," to enter it and form our own
conclusions. The great drawback to an attempt to see
North Carolina, however, lies in the fact that North
Carolina is, so to speak, spread very thin. It has no
great solid central city occupying a place in its thoughts
and its affairs corresponding to that occupied by Richmond,
in its relation to Virginia. Like Mississippi, it is
a State of small towns and small cities. Its metropolis,
Charlotte, had, by the 1910 census, less than 35,000 inhabitants;
its seaport, Wilmington, a little more than
25,000; its capital, Raleigh, less than 20,000; its beautiful
mountain resort, Asheville, fourth city in the State,
less than 19,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>I hasten to add that the next census will undoubtedly
show considerable growth in all these cities. In Raleigh
I found every one insistent on this point. The town is
growing; it is a going place; a great deal of new building
is in progress; and when you ask about the population,
progressive citizens are prepared to do much better
by their city than the census takers did, some years ago.
They talk thirty thousand, instead of twenty, and they
are ready with astonishing statistics about the number
of students in the schools and colleges as compared with
the total population of the city&mdash;statistics showing that
though Raleigh is not large she is progressive. Which
is quite true.</p>

<p>I recollect that Judge Francis D. Winston, former
Lieutenant Governor of the State, United States District
Attorney, and the most engaging raconteur in the
Carolinas, contributed a story to a discussion of
Raleigh's population, which occurred, one evening, at a
dinner at the Country Club.</p>

<p>"A promoter," he said, "was once trying to borrow
money on a boom town. He went to a banker and
showed him a map, not of what the town was, but of
what he claimed it was going to be. 'Here,' he said,
'is where the town hall will stand. In this lot will be
the opera house. Over here we are going to have a
beautiful park. And on this corner we are going to
erect a tall granite office building.'</p>

<p>"'But,' said the banker, coldly, 'we lend money only
on the basis of population.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That's all right,' returned the promoter. 'Measured
by any known standard except an actual <i>count</i>, we
have a population of two hundred thousand.'"</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to point this tale more than to
recommend it to the attention of the secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce in every city in the United
States.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Raleigh is situated within seven miles of the exact
center of North Carolina. The land on which the city
stands was purchased by the State, in 1792, from a man
named Joel Lane, whose former house still stands. The
town was then laid out in a one mile square, with the
site selected for the State Capitol directly at the center
of it, and lots were sold off by the State to individuals,
the proceeds of these sales being used to build the Capitol.
As a result the parks, streets and sidewalks of
the original old town still belong to the State of North
Carolina, and the city has jurisdiction over them only by
courtesy of the State government. Raleigh has, of
course, much outgrown its original dimensions, and the
government of the town, outside the original square mile
at the center, is as in other towns.</p>

<p>While Raleigh has not the look of age which characterizes
many old southern cities, causing them to delight
the eye and the imagination, its broad streets have
here and there a building old enough to remove from
the town any air of raw newness, and to make it a homelike
looking place. The sidewalks are wide; when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
were in Raleigh those of the principal streets were
paved largely with soft-colored old red bricks, which,
however, were being taken up and replaced with cement.
Not being a resident of Raleigh, and consequently not
having been obliged to tread the rough brick pavements
daily, I was sorry to witness this victory of utility over
beauty.</p>

<p>One of the pleasant old buildings is the Yarborough
Hotel, at which my companion and I stayed. The Yarborough
is an exceedingly good hotel for a city of the
size of Raleigh, especially, it may be added, when that
city is in the South. The Capitol, standing among trees
in a small park, also gathers a fine flavor from age. In
one of the many simple dignified apartments of this
building my companion and I were introduced to the
gentleman who was governor of the State at the time
of our visit. It seemed to me that he had a look both
worn and apprehensive, and that, while we talked, he
was waiting for something. I don't know how I gathered
this impression, but it came to me definitely. After
we had departed from the executive chamber I asked
the gentleman who had taken us there if the governor
was ill.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "All our governors look like that
after they have been in office for a while."</p>

<p>"From overwork?"</p>

<p>"No, from an overworked jest&mdash;the jest about 'what
the Governor of North Carolina said to the Governor of
South Carolina.' Every one who meets the governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
thinks of that joke and believes confidently that no one
has ever before thought of this application of it. So
they all pull it on him. For the first few months our
governors stand it pretty well, but after that they begin
to break down. They feel they ought to smile, but they
can't. They begin to dread meeting strangers, and to
show it in their bearing. When in private life our governor
had a very pleasant expression, but like all the
others, he has acquired, in office, the expression of an
iron dog."</p>

<p>Raleigh's most widely-known citizen is Josephus
Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, and publisher of the
Raleigh "News and Observer." This paper, published
in the morning, and the "Times," a rival paper, published
in the afternoon, are, I believe, the only dailies in
the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniels has been so much discussed that I was
greatly interested in hearing what Raleigh had to say
of him. Every one knew him personally. The men on
his paper seemed to be very fond of him; others held
various opinions.</p>

<p>In 1894 Mr. Daniels came from Washington, D.&nbsp;C.,
where he had been chief clerk in the Department of the
Interior, when Hoke Smith was Secretary, and acquired
the newspaper of which he has since been proprietor.
In its first years under Mr. Daniels, the paper is said
to have gone through severe financial struggles, and
there is an amusing story current, about the way the
payroll was met upon one occasion. According to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
tale, the business manager of the paper came to Mr.
Daniels, one day, and informed him that he needed sixty
dollars more to make the payroll, and didn't know where
he was going to get it. The only ready asset in sight,
it is related, was several cases of a patent medicine
known as "Mrs. Joe Persons' Remedy," which had been
taken by the "News and Observer" in payment for advertising
space. Mr. Daniels had a few dollars, and his
business manager had a railroad pass. With these resources
the latter went out on the road and sold the
patent medicine for enough to make up the deficit.</p>

<p>Until Mr. Daniels was appointed Secretary of the
Navy he seems to have been regarded by many citizens
of Raleigh, as a good, earnest, hard-working man, possessed
of considerable personal magnetism and a good
political nose&mdash;a man who could scent how the pack was
running, take a short-cut, and presently appear to be
leading. In other words an opportunist. Though he
has not much education, and though as a writer he is
far from polished, it is said that he has written powerful
editorials. "When his editorials have been good," said
one gentleman, "it is because he has been stirred up over
something, and because he manages sometimes to get
into his writing the intensity of his own personality."
His office used to be, and still is, when he is in Raleigh,
a sort of political headquarters, and he used to be able
to write editorials while half a dozen politicians were
sitting around his desk, talking.</p>

<p>With his paper he has done much good in the State,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
notably by fighting consistently for prohibition and for
greater public educational advantages. The strong educational
movement in North Carolina began with a
group of men chief among whom were the late Governor
Charles B. Aycock, called "the educational governor";
Dr. E.&nbsp;A. Alderman, who, though president of the University
of Virginia, is a North Carolinian and was formerly
president of the University of that State; Dr.
Charles D. McKeever who committed the State to the
principle of higher education for women, and other men
of similar high purpose. A gentleman who was far
from an unqualified admirer of Mr. Daniels, told me
that without his aid the great educational advance which
the state has certainly made of recent years could hardly
have been accomplished, and that the same thing applies
in the case of prohibition&mdash;which has been adopted in
North Carolina.</p>

<p>"What sort of man is he?" I asked this gentleman.</p>

<p>"He is the old type of Methodist," he said. "He is
the kind of man who believes that the whale swallowed
Jonah. He has the same concept of religion that he
had as a child. I differ with his policies, his politics, his
mental methods, but I don't think anybody here doubts
that he is trying, not only to do the moral thing himself,
but to force others to adopt, as rules for public conduct,
the exact code in which he personally believes, and which
he certainly follows. His mental processes are often
crude, yet he has much native shrewdness and the ability
to grasp situations as they arise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"He does not come of the aristocratic class, which
probably accounts for his failure, when he first became
secretary, to perceive the necessity for discipline in the
navy, and the benefits of naval tradition.</p>

<p>"He was an ardent follower&mdash;I might say swallower&mdash;of
Bryan, gobbling whole all of the "Great Commoner's"
vagaries. It has been said, more or less humorously,
but doubtless with a foundation of fact, that he
was "Secretary of War in all of Bryan's cabinets."
That shows where Bryan placed him. Yet when Bryan
broke with Wilson and made his exit from the Cabinet,
Daniels found it perfectly simple, apparently, to drop
the Bryanism which had, hitherto, been the very essence
of his life, and become a no less ardent supporter of the
President.</p>

<p>"When he was first taken into the cabinet he evidently
regarded the finer social amenities as matters of no consequence,
or even as effeminacies. He had but little
sense of the fitness of things, and was, in consequence,
continually making <i>faux pas</i>; but he is observant; he has
learned a great deal in the course of his life as a cabinet
member, both as to his work in the Department, and as
to the niceties of formal social life."</p>

<p>At the time of our visit to Raleigh I had not met Mr.
Daniels, nor heard him speak. Since that time I have
heard him several times and have talked with him.
Also I have talked of him with a number of men who
have been thrown more or less closely in contact with
him. As is well known, naval officers detested him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
peculiar unanimity. This was true up to the time of
our entering the War. Whether matters have changed
greatly since then I am unable to say. One officer, well
known in the navy, said to me quite seriously that he
believed the navy would be better off without its two
best dreadnoughts if in losing them it could also lose Mr.
Daniels. Such sentiments were peculiarly unanimous
among officers. On the other hand, however, a high
officer, who has been quite close to the Secretary, informs
me that it is indeed true that he has improved as
experience has come to him. This officer stated that
when Mr. Daniels first took office he seemed to be definitely
antagonistic to officers of the navy. "He appeared
to suspect them of pulling political wires and
working in their own interests. That was in the days
when he seemed almost to encourage insubordination
among the enlisted men, by his attitude toward them, in
contrast to his attitude towards their superiors. Of
course it was demoralizing to the service. But there
has been a marked change in the Secretary since Bryan
left the Cabinet." From several sources I have heard
the same evidence. I never heard any one say that Mr.
Daniels was really an able Secretary of the Navy, but I
have heard many say that he improved.</p>

<p>Personally he is a very likable man. His face is kind
and gentle; his features are interestingly irregular and
there are heavy wrinkles about his mouth and eyes&mdash;the
former adding something to the already humorous
twinkle of the eyes. His voice has a <i>timbre</i> reminding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
me of George M. Cohan's voice. He is hardly an orator
in the sense that Bryan is, yet he is not without simple
oratorical tricks&mdash;as for example a tremolo, as of
emotion, which I have heard him use in uttering
such a phrase as "the grea-<i>a-a-at</i> Daniel <i>Web</i>-ster!"
Also, he wears a low turnover collar and a black
string tie&mdash;a fact which would not be worth noting did
these not form a part of what amounts almost to a
uniform worn by politicians of more or less the Bryan
type. Almost invariably there seems to be something
of the minister and something of the actor in such
men.</p>

<p>Once I asked one of the famous Washington correspondents
what manner of man Mr. Daniels was.</p>

<p>"He's a man," he said, "that you'd like to go with on
a hunting trip in his native North Carolina. He would
be a good companion and would have a lot of funny
stories. He is full of kind intentions. Had you known
him before the War, and had he liked you, and had you
wished to take a ride upon a battleship, he would be disposed
to order up a battleship and send you for a ride,
even if, by doing so, he muddled up the fleet a little.
That would be in line with his fixing it for moving picture
people to act scenes on a battleship's deck&mdash;which
he permitted. He saw no reason why that was not
proper, and the kind of people who admire him most are
those who, likewise, see no reason why it was not proper.
The great lack in his nature is that of personal dignity&mdash;or
even the dignity which should be his because of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
position. If you are sitting beside him and he is
amiably disposed toward you, he may throw his arm
over your shoulder, or massage your knee while talking
with you.</p>

<p>"But if some friend of his were to go to him and convince
him that he lacked dignity, he is the kind of man
who, in my judgment, would become so much the worse.
That is, if he attempted to attain dignity he would not
achieve it, but would merely grow arbitrary. That, to
my mind, shows his great ineradicable weakness, for it
not only reveals him as a man too little for his job, but
prevents his comprehending the basic thing upon which
naval discipline is founded. Nevertheless, as a man
you like him. It is as Secretary of the Navy, and particularly
as a War Secretary, that you very definitely
don't."</p>

<p>Some time after our visit to Raleigh my companion
and I heard Secretary Daniels speak in Charleston. He
told a funny story and talked generalities about the navy.
That was before the United States entered the War. I
do not know what he meant the speech for, but what it
actually was, was a speech against preparedness. So
was the speech made on the same occasion by Lemuel P.
Padgett, chairman of the House Committee on Naval
Affairs. It was a disingenuous speech, a speech to lull
the country into confidence, a speech which, alone, should
have been sufficient to prove Mr. Padgett's unfitness to
serve on that committee. Mr. Daniels argued that
"Germany's preparedness had not kept Germany out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
war"; that seemed enough, but there was one thing he
said which utterly dumbfounded me. It was this:</p>

<p>"<i>The Southern statesman who serves his section best,
serves the country best.</i>"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<a name="p280jpg" id="p280jpg"></a>
<img src="images/p280.jpg" width="386" height="600" alt="&quot;The Southern Statesman who serves his section best, serves the country best.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The Southern Statesman who serves his section best, serves the country best.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Let the reader reflect for a moment upon such an utterance.
Carried a little farther what would it mean?
Would it not be equally logical to say that the man who
serves himself best serves the country best? It is the
theory of narrow sectionalism, and by implication, at
least, the theory of individualism as well. And sectionalism
and individualism are two of the great curses of
the United States.</p>

<p>Compare with Mr. Daniels' words those of John Hay
who, veiling fine patriotism beneath a web of delicate
humor, said:</p>

<p>"<i>In my bewilderment of origin and experience I can
only put on an aspect of deep humility in any gathering
of favorite sons, and confess that I am nothing but an
American.</i>"</p>

<p>Or again, compare with them the famous words of
Patrick Henry:</p>

<p>"<i>I am not a Virginian, but an American.</i>"</p>

<p>Clearly, one point of view or the other is wrong. Perhaps
Mr. Daniels has more light on sectional questions
than had Patrick Henry or John Hay. At all events,
the Charleston audience applauded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<br />
ITEMS FROM "THE OLD NORTH STATE"</h2>


<p>Two of the most interesting things we saw in
Raleigh were the model jail on the top floor of
the new County Court House, where a lot of very
honest looking rustics were confined to await trial for
making "blockade" (otherwise moonshine) whisky, and
the North Carolina Hall of History, which occupies a
floor in the fine new State Administration Building, opposite
the Capitol. At the head of the first stair landing
in the Administration Building is a memorial tablet to
William Sidney Porter ("O Henry"), who was born in
Greensboro, North Carolina, with a bust of the author,
in relief, by Lorado Taft. Porter, it may be mentioned,
was a connection of Worth Bagley, the young ensign
who was the only American naval officer killed in the
Spanish-American War. Bagley was a brother of Mrs.
Josephus Daniels. A monument to him stands in the
park before the Capitol. Aside from Porter, the only
author well known in our time whom I heard mentioned
in connection with North Carolina, was the Rev.
Thomas Dixon, whose name is most familiar, perhaps,
in connection with the moving-picture called "The Birth
of a Nation," taken from one of his novels. Mr. Dixon
was born in the town of Shelby, North Carolina, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
was for some years pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist
Church, Raleigh.</p>

<p>The Hall of History, containing a great variety of
State relics, is one of the most fascinating museums I
ever visited. Too much praise cannot be given Colonel
Fred A. Olds and Mr. Marshall De Lancey Haywood,
of the North Carolina Historical Society, for making it
what it is. As with the Confederate Museum in Richmond,
so, here, it is impossible to give more than a faint
idea of the interest of the museum's contents. Among
the exhibits of which I made note, I shall, however, mention
a few. There was a letter written from Paris in
the handwriting of John Paul Jones, requesting a copy
of the Constitution of North Carolina; there was the Ku
Klux warning issued to one Ben Turner of Northampton
County; and there was an old newspaper advertisement
signed by James J. Selby, a tailor, dated at Raleigh,
June 24, 1824, offering a reward of ten dollars for the
capture and return of two runaways: "apprentice boys,
legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson."
The last named boy was the same Andrew Johnson who
later became a distinctly second-rate President of the
United States. Also there was a peculiarly tragic Civil
War memento, consisting of a note which was found
clasped in the dead hand of Colonel Isaac Avery, of the
6th North Carolina Regiment, who was killed while
commanding a brigade on the second day at Gettysburg.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Tell my father I died with my face to the enemy.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>These words were written by the fallen officer with his
left hand, his right arm having been rendered useless
by his mortal wound. For ink he used his own life
blood.</p>

<p>Also in the museum may be seen the chart-book of
Blackbeard, the pirate, who, one of the curators of the
museum informed me, was the same person as Edward
Teach. Blackbeard, who is commemorated in the name
of Blackbeard's Island, off the coast of South Georgia,
met his fate when he encountered a cruiser fitted out by
Governor Spotswood of Virginia and commanded by
Lieutenant Maynard. Maynard found Blackbeard's
ship at Okracoke Inlet, on the North Carolina coast.
Before he and his men could board the pirate vessel the
pirates came and boarded them. Severe fighting ensued,
but the pirates were defeated, Maynard himself
killing Blackbeard in single combat with swords. The
legend around Okracoke is that Blackbeard's bad fortune
on this occasion came to him because of the unlucky
number of his matrimonial adventures, the story being
that he had thirteen wives. It is said also that his vanquishers
cut off his head and hung it at the yard-arm
of their ship, throwing his body into the sea, and that
as soon as the body struck the water the head began to
call, "Come on, Edward!" whereupon the headless body
swam three times around the ship. Personally I think
there may be some slight doubt about the authenticity
of this part of the story. For, while from one point of
view we might say that to swim about in such aimless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
fashion would be the very thing a man without a head
might do, yet from another point of view the question
arises: Would a man whose head had just been severed
from his body feel like taking such a long swim?</p>

<p>And what a rich lot of other historic treasures!</p>

<p>Did you know, for instance, that Flora Macdonald,
the Scottish heroine, who helped Prince Charles Edward
to escape, dressed as a maidservant, after the Battle of
Culloden, in 1746, came to America with her husband
and many relatives just before the Revolutionary War
and settled at Cross Creek (now Fayetteville), North
Carolina? When General Donald Macdonald raised
the Royal standard at the time of the Revolution, her
husband and many of her kinsmen joined him, and these
were later captured at the Battle of Moore's Creek
Bridge, in 1776, and taken as prisoners to Philadelphia.
Yes; and Flora Macdonald's garter-buckles are now in
the museum at Raleigh.</p>

<p>A portrait of Captain James J. Waddell, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., who
was a member of a famous North Carolina family, recalls
the story of his post-bellum cruise, in command of
the <i>Shenandoah</i>, when, not knowing that the War was
over, he preyed for months on Federal commerce in the
South Seas.</p>

<p>The museum of course contains many uniforms worn
by distinguished soldiers of the Confederacy and many
old flags, among them one said to be the original flag of
the Confederacy. This flag was designed by Orren R.
Smith of Louisburg, North Carolina, and was made in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that town. The journals of the Confederate Congress
show that countless designs for a flag were submitted,
that the Committee on a Flag reported that all designs
had been rejected and returned, the committee having
adopted one of its own; nevertheless Mr. Smith's claim
to have designed the flag finally adopted is so well supported
that the Confederate Veterans, at their General
Reunion held in Richmond in 1915, passed a resolution
endorsing it.</p>

<p>Also in the museum is the shot-riddled smokestack of
the Confederate ram <i>Albemarle</i>, which was built on the
farm of Peter E. Smith, on Roanoke River, and is said
to have been the first vessel ever launched sidewise.
The <i>Albemarle</i>, after a glorious career, was sunk by
Lieutenant Cushing, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., in his famous exploit with
a torpedo carried on a pole at the bow of a launch. It
will be remembered that the launch was sunk by the
shock and that only Cushing and one member of his
crew survived, swimming away under fire.</p>

<p>North Carolina also claims&mdash;and not without some
justice&mdash;that the first English settlement on this continent
was not that at Jamestown, but the one made by
Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition, under Amadas and Barlowe,
which landed at Roanoke Island, August 4, 1584,
and remained there for some weeks. The Jamestown
Colony, say the North Carolinians, was merely the first
to <i>stick</i>.</p>

<p>Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, across the sound from
Roanoke Island, is the site of the first flight of a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
in an aeroplane, the Wright brothers having tried out
their first crude plane there, among the Kill-Devil sand
dunes. A part of the original plane is preserved in the
museum. Nor must I leave the museum without mentioning
the bullet-riddled hat of General W.&nbsp;R. Cox, and
his gray military coat, with a blood-stained gash in
front, where a solid shell ripped across. General Cox's
son, Mr. Albert Cox, was with us in the museum when
we stopped to look at this grim souvenir. "It tore father
open in front," he said, "spoiled a coat which had
cost him $550, Confederate, and damaged his watchchain.
Nevertheless he lived to take part in the last
charge at Appomattox, and the watchchain wasn't so
badly spoiled but what, with the addition of some new
links, it could be worn." And he showed us where the
chain, which he himself was wearing at the time, had
been repaired.</p>

<p>I must say something, also, of the North Carolina College
of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, an institution
doing splendid work, and doing it efficiently, both in its
own buildings and through extension courses. Fifty-two
per cent. of the students at this college earn their
way through, either wholly or in part. And better yet,
eighty-three per cent. of the graduates stick to the practical
work afterwards&mdash;an unusually high record.</p>

<p>The president of the college, Dr. D.&nbsp;H. Hill, is a son
of the Confederate general of the same name, who has
been called "the Ironsides of the South."</p>

<p>There are a number of other important educational<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
institutions in and about Raleigh, and there is one
which, if not important, is at all events, a curio. This is
"Latta University," consisting of a few flimsy shacks
in the negro village of Oberlin, on the outskirts of
Raleigh.</p>

<p>"Professor" Latta is one of the rare negroes who combines
the habit with white folks of the old fashioned
southern darky, and the astuteness of the "new issue"
in high finance. Years ago he conceived the idea of
establishing a negro school near Raleigh, to which he
gave the above mentioned name. He had no funds, no
credit and little or no education. Nevertheless he had
ideas, the central one of which was that New England
was the land of plenty. With the "university" in his
head, and with a miscellaneous collection of photographs,
he managed to make a tour of northern cities, and came
back with his pockets lined. As a result he procured a
little land, put up frame buildings, gathered a few youths
about him, and was fully launched on his career as a
university president.</p>

<p>So long as the money held out, Latta was content to
drift along with his school. When he came to the bottom
of the bag he invested the last of his savings in another
ticket north and, armed with his title of "president,"
made addresses to northern audiences and replenished
his finances with their contributions.</p>

<p>Finally, as the great act of his career, Latta managed
to get passage to Europe and was gone for several
months. When he came back he had added a manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>script
to his possessions: "The History of My Life and
Work," which he published, and which is one of the most
curious volumes I have ever seen.</p>

<p>It is illustrated&mdash;largely with photographs of the
author. One of the pictures is entitled, "Rev. M.&nbsp;L.
Latta when he first commenced to build Latta University."
This shows Latta with the tips of his fingers resting
on a small table. Another picture shows him posed
with one hand raised and the other resting on what is
unmistakably the same little table. The latter picture,
however, has the caption, "Rev. M.&nbsp;L. Latta making a
speech in Pawtucket, R.&nbsp;I., at Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A." Both pictures
were all too clearly taken in a photographer's
studio. Another page shows us, "Rev. M.&nbsp;L. Latta and
three of his Admirable Presidents." In this case Latta
merely takes for himself the upper right-hand corner,
the other eminent persons pictured being ex-Presidents
Roosevelt, McKinley and Cleveland. The star illustration,
however, is a "made up" picture, in which a photograph
of Latta, looking spick-and-span, has been pasted
onto what is very obviously a painted picture of a hall
full of people in evening dress, all of them gazing at
Latta, who stands upon the stage, dignified, suave, impressive,
and all dressed-up by the brush of the "re-toucher."
This picture is called: "In the Auditorium
at London, in 1894." Similar artfulness is shown in
pictures of the "university" buildings, where the same
frame structure, photographed from opposite ends, appears
in one case as, "Young Ladies' Dormitory," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
in the other as, "Chapel and Young Men's Dormitory."</p>

<p>In his autobiography, Latta tells how, in the course
of getting his own schooling, he raised money by teaching
a district school during vacation. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After paying my expenses, I had nearly a hundred dollars to
return to school with. When I returned I was able to dress very
neatly indeed, and the young ladies received me very cordially on
the green during social hour. Before I taught school it was a
common saying among the young ladies and young men "Latta";
but after I returned with a hundred dollars it was "Mr. Latta"
all over the campus. I would hear the young ladies saying among
themselves, "I bet Mr. Latta will not go with you&mdash;he will correspond
with me this afternoon." I paid no attention to it. I
said to myself, "Don't you see what a hundred dollars will do?"</p></div>

<p>In another place the Professor reveals how he came
to write his book: "Professor King, one of the teachers
at Latta University said to me, 'If I had done what
you have done I would have wrote a history of my life
several years ago.'"</p>

<p>The best part of the book, however, gives us Latta's
account of his doings in London:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Just before I left the city of London I was invited by a distinguished
friend, a close relation to Queen Victoria, to make
a speech. He told me there would be a meeting in one of the
large halls in that city. I can't just think of the name of the
hall. He invited me to be present. The distinguished friend
that I have just mentioned presided over the meeting. There was
an immense audience present. If memory serves me right, I was
the only Negro in the hall. The gentleman came to me and
asked if I would make a speech. I told him I had already deliv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ered
one address, besides several sermons I had preached, and I
thought that I would not speak again during my stay. I accepted
the invitation, however, and spoke.</p></div>

<p>The Professor then tells how he was introduced as
one whose addresses were "among the ablest ever delivered
in London." Also he gives his speech in full.
Great events followed. His distinguished unnamed
friend, the "close relation of the Queen," came to him
soon after, he says, and asked him if he had "ever been
to the palace."</p>

<p>Continues Latta:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He said to me, "If you will come over before you leave the
city, and call to see me, I will take you to the palace with me
and introduce you to the Queen." I told him I would do so,
that I had heard a good deal about the royal throne, and I would
be very much interested to see the palace. He said he thought
I would, because the government was very different from ours.</p>

<p>I called at his residence as I had promised, and he went with
me to the palace. The Queen knew him, of course. He was received
very cordially. Everything shined so much like gold in
the palace that I had to stop and think where I was. He introduced
me to the Queen, and told her I was from North America.
He told her that I spoke at a meeting he presided over, and he
enjoyed my speech very much. He told her we had an immense
audience, and all the people were well pleased with the speech.
The Queen said she was more than glad to meet me, and she
would have liked very much to have been present, and heard the
speech that her cousin said I made.... She told me she hoped
that would not be the last visit I would make to their city. I
shook hands with her and bade her good-bye. The distinguished
friend carried me and showed me the different departments of
the palace, and I bade him good-bye.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>In Raleigh, I think, they rather like Latta. It amuses
them to see him go north and get money, and it is said
that he appreciates the situation himself. He ought to.
Not many southern negroes have such comfortable
homes as "Latta University's" best kept-up building&mdash;the
residence of the President.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said&mdash;by Mrs. T.&nbsp;P. O'Connor, I think&mdash;that
whereas twenty-five letters of introduction for
New York may produce one invitation to dinner,
one letter of introduction for Charleston will produce
twenty-five dinner invitations. If this be an
exaggeration it is, at least, exaggeration in the right
direction; that is, along the lines of truth. For though
Charleston's famed "exclusiveness" is very real, making
letters of introduction very necessary to strangers desiring
to see something of the city's social life, such
letters produce, in Charleston, as Mrs. O'Connor suggests,
results definite and delightful.</p>

<p>Immediately upon our arrival, my companion and I
sent out several letters we had brought with us, and
presently calling cards began to arrive for us at the
hotel. Also there came courteous little notes, delivered
in most cases by hand, according to the old Charleston
custom&mdash;a custom surviving pleasantly from times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
when there were no postal arrangements, but plenty of
slaves to run errands. Even to this day, I am told, invitations
to Charleston's famous St. Cecilia balls are
delivered by hand.</p>

<p>One of the notes we received revealed to us a characteristic
custom of the city. It contained an invitation
to occupy places in the pew of a distinguished family, at
St. Michael's Church, on the approaching Sunday morning.
In order to realize the significance of such an
invitation one must understand that St. Michael's is
to Charleston, socially, what St. George's, Hanover
Square, is to London. A beautiful old building, surrounded
by a historic burial ground and surmounted by
a delicate white spire containing fine chimes, it strongly
suggests the architectural touch of Sir Christopher
Wren; but it is not by Wren, for he died a number of
years before 1752, when the cornerstone of St. Michael's
was laid. When the British left Charleston&mdash;or
Charles Town, as the name of the place stands in the
early records&mdash;after occupying it during the Revolutionary
War, they took with them, to the horror of the
city, the bells of St. Michael's, and the church books.
The silver, however, was saved, having been concealed
on a plantation some miles from Charleston. Later the
bells were returned.</p>

<p>Pre-Revolutionary Charleston was divided into two
parishes: St. Michael's below Broad Street, and St.
Philip's above. Under governmental regulation citizens
were not allowed to hold pews in both churches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
unless they owned houses in both parishes. St. Michael's,
being nearer the battery, in which region are the
finest old houses, had, perhaps, the wealthier congregation,
but St. Philip's is, to my mind, the more beautiful
church of the two, largely because of the open space
before it, and the graceful outward bend of Church
Street in deference to the projecting portico.</p>

<span class="caption">St. Philip&#39;s is the more beautiful for the open space before it, and the graceful
outward bend of Church Street in deference to the projecting portico</span>
</div>

<p>When the Civil War broke out St. Philip's bells were
melted and made into cannon, but those of St. Michael's
were left in place until cannonballs from the blockading
fleet struck the church, when they were taken down and
sent, together with the silver plate, to Columbia, South
Carolina, for safe-keeping. But Columbia was, as matters
turned out, the worst place to which they could have
been sent. The silver was looted by troops under Sherman,
and the bells were destroyed when the city was
burned. The fragments were, however, collected and
sent to England, whence the bells originally came, and
there they were recast. Their music&mdash;perhaps the most
characteristic of all the city's characteristic sounds&mdash;has
been called "the voice of Charleston." Of the silver
only a few fragments have been returned. One piece
was found in a pawn shop in New York, and another in
a small town in Ohio. <i>Mais que voulez-vous? C'est
la guerre!</i></p>

<p>In mentioning Charleston churches one becomes involved
in a large matter. In 1801, when St. Mary's, the
first Roman Catholic church in the city, was erected,
there were already eighteen churches in existence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
among them the present Huguenot Church, at the corner
of Church and Queen Streets, which, though a very old
building, is nevertheless the second Huguenot Church to
occupy the same site, the first, built in 1687, having been
destroyed in the great conflagration of 1796, which very
nearly destroyed St. Philip's, as well. A number of
the old Huguenot families long ago became Episcopalians,
and the descendants of many of the early French
settlers of Charleston, buried in the Huguenot churchyard,
are now parishioners of St. Michael's and St.
Philip's. The Huguenot Church in Charleston is the
only church of this denomination in America; its liturgy
is translated from the French, and services are held in
French on the third Sunday of November, January and
March. A Unitarian Church was established in 1817,
as an offshoot of the Scotch Presbyterian Church, the
old White Meeting House of which (built 1685, used by
the British as a granary, during the Revolution, and
torn down 1806) gave Meeting Street its name. Early
in the history of the Unitarian Church, the home of
which was a former Presbyterian Church building, in
Archdale Street, Dr. Samuel Gilman, a young minister
from Gloucester, Massachusetts, became its pastor.
This was the same Dr. Gilman who wrote "Fair Harvard."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In only one instance did the letters of introduction we
sent out produce a response of the kind one would not
be surprised at receiving in some rushing city of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
North: a telephone call. A lady, not a native Charlestonian,
but one who has lived actively about the world,
rang us up, bade us welcome, and invited us to dinner.</p>

<p>But she was a very modern sort of lady, as witness
not only her use of the telephone&mdash;an instrument which
seems in Charleston almost an anachronism; as, for that
matter, the automobile does, too&mdash;but her dinner hour,
which was eight o'clock. Very few Charleston families
dine at night. Dinner invitations are usually for three,
or perhaps half-past three or four, in the afternoon, and
there is a light supper in the evening. I judge that this
custom holds also in some other cities of the region, for
I remember calling at the office of a large investment
company in Wilmington, North Carolina, to find it
wearing, at three in the afternoon, the deserted look of
a New York office between twelve and one o'clock.
Every one had gone home to dinner. Mr. W.&nbsp;D. Howells,
in his charming essay on Charleston, makes mention
of this matter:</p>

<p>"The place," he says, "has its own laws and usages,
and does not trouble itself to conform to those of other
aristocracies. In London the best society dines at eight
o'clock, and in Madrid at nine, but in Charleston it dines
at four.... It makes morning calls as well as afternoon
calls, but as the summer approaches the midday
heat must invite rather to the airy leisure of the verandas,
and the cool quiescence of interiors darkened
against the fly in the morning and the mosquito at night-fall."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>The household fly is a year-round resident of Charleston,
by grace of a climate which permits&mdash;barely permits,
at its coldest&mdash;the use of the open surrey as a
public vehicle in all seasons. Sometimes, during a winter
cold-snap, when a ride in a surrey is not a pleasant
thing to contemplate, when residents of old mansions
have shut themselves into a room or two heated by grate
fires, then the fly seems to have disappeared, but let the
cold abate a little and out he comes again like some
rogue who, after brief and spurious penance, resumes
the evil of his ways.</p>

<p>The stranger going to a humble Charleston house will
find on the gate a coiled spring at the end of which hangs
a bell. By touching the spring and causing the bell
to jingle he makes his presence known. The larger
houses have upon their gates bell-pulls or buttons which
cause bells to ring within. This is true of all houses
which have front gardens. The garden gate constitutes,
by custom, a barrier comparable in a degree with
the front door of a Northern house; a usage arising,
doubtless, out of the fact that almost all important
Charleston houses have not only gardens, but first and
second story galleries, and that in hot weather these
galleries become, as it were, exterior rooms, in which no
small part of the family life goes on. Many Charleston
houses have their gardens to the rear, and themselves
abut upon the sidewalk. Calling at such houses, you
ring at what seems to be an ordinary front door, but
when the door is opened you find yourself entering not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
upon a hall, but upon an exterior gallery running to the
full depth of the house, down which you walk to the
actual house door. In still other houses&mdash;and this is
true of some of the most notable mansions of the city,
including the Pringle, Huger, and Rhett houses&mdash;admittance
is by a street door of the normal sort, opening
upon a hall, and the galleries and gardens are at the side
or back, the position of the galleries in relation to the
house depending upon what point of the compass the
house faces, the desirable thing being to get the breezes
which are prevalently from the southwest and the westward.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Charleston is very definitely two things: It is old,
and it is a city.</p>

<p>There is the story of a young lady who asked a
stranger if he did not consider it a unique town.</p>

<p>He agreed that it was, and inquired whether she knew
the derivation of the word "unique."</p>

<p>When she replied negatively he informed her that the
word came from the Latin <i>unus</i>, meaning "one," and
<i>equus</i>, meaning "a horse"; otherwise "a one-horse town."</p>

<p>This tale, however, is a libel, for despite the general
superstition of chambers of commerce to the contrary,
the estate of cityhood is not necessarily a matter of
population nor yet of commerce. That is one of the
things which, if we were unaware of it before, we may
learn from Charleston. Charleston is not great in
population; it is not very great, as seaports go, in trade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Were cities able to talk with one another as men can,
and as foolishly as men often do, I have no doubt that
many a hustling middle-western city would patronize
Charleston, precisely as a parvenue might patronize a
professor of astronomy; nevertheless, Charleston has a
stronger, deeper-rooted city entity than all the cities of
the Middle West rolled into one. This is no exaggeration.
Where modern American cities strive to be like
one another, Charleston strives to be like nothing whatsoever.
She does not have to strive to <i>be</i> something.
She <i>is</i> something. She understands what most other
American cities do not understand, and what, in view of
our almost unrestricted immigration laws, it seems the
National Government cannot be made to understand:
namely, that mere numbers do not count for everything;
that there is the matter of quality of population to
be considered. Therefore, though Charleston's white
population is no greater than that of many a place which
would own itself frankly a small town, Charleston
knows that by reason of the character of its population
it is a great city. And that is precisely the case.
Charleston people are city people <i>par excellence</i>. They
have the virtues of city people, the vices of city people,
and the civilization and sophistication of those who reside
in the most aristocratic capitals. For that is another
thing that Charleston is; it is unqualifiedly the
aristocratic capital of the United States; the last stronghold
of a unified American upper class; the last remaining
American city in which Madeira and Port and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<i>noblesse oblige</i> are fully and widely understood, and are
employed according to the best traditions.</p>

<p>I have been told of a lady who remarked that Charleston
was "the biggest little place" she ever saw. I say
the same. The littleness of the place, it is sometimes
pointed out, is expressed by the "vast cousinship" which
constitutes Charleston society, but it is to my mind expressed
much better in the way bicyclists leave their
machines leaning against the curb at the busiest parts of
main shopping streets. Its bigness, upon the other
hand, is expressed by the homes from which some of
those bicyclists come, by the cultivation which exists in
those homes, and has existed there for generations, by
the amenities of life as they are comprehended and observed,
by the wealth of the city's tradition and the
richness of its background. Nor is that background a
mere arras of recollection. It exists everywhere in the
wood and brick and stone of ancient and beautiful buildings,
in iron grilles and balconies absolutely unrivaled
in any other American city, and equaled only in European
cities most famous for their artistry in wrought
iron. It exists also in venerable institutions&mdash;the first
orphanage established in the United States; the William
Enston Home; the Public Library, one of the first and
now one of the best libraries in the country; the art
museum, the St. Cecilia Society, and various old clubs.
More intimately it exists within innumerable old homes,
which are treasure-houses of fine old English and early
American furniture and of portraits&mdash;portraits by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Sir Joshua, by Stuart, Copley, Trumbull, and most of
the other portrait painters who painted from the time
the Colonies began to become civilized to the time of the
Civil War&mdash;among them S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. Morse, who, I believe
it is not generally known, made a considerable reputation
as a portrait painter, in Charleston, before he made
himself a world figure by inventing the telegraph.</p>

<p>Even without seeing these private treasures the visitor
to Charleston will see enough to convince him that
Charleston is indeed "unique"&mdash;though not in the sense
implied in the story&mdash;that it is the most intimately beautiful
city upon the American continent.</p>

<span class="caption">In the doorway and gates of the Smyth house, in Legar&eacute; Street, I was struck

</div>

<p>To call Charleston "unique," and immediately thereafter
to liken it to other places may seem paradoxical.
These likenesses are, however, evanescent. It is not
that Charleston is actually like other places, but that
here in a church building, there in an old tile roof,
wrought iron gate, or narrow cobbled street, the visitor
will find himself delicately reminded of Old World towns
and cities. Mr. Howells, for example, found on the
East Battery a faint suggestion of Venetian palaces, and
in the doorway and gates of the Smyth house, in Legar&eacute;
Street, I was struck, also, with a Venetian suggestion so
strange and subtle that I could not quite account for it.
At night some of the old narrow streets, between Meeting
Street and Bay, made me think of streets in the old
part of Paris, on the left bank of the Seine; or again I
would stop before an ancient brick house which was
Flemish, or which&mdash;in the case of houses diagonally op<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>posite
St. Philip's Church&mdash;exampled the rude architecture
of an old French village, stucco walls colored and
chipped, red tile roof and all. The busy part of King
Street, on a Saturday night when the fleet was in, made
me think of Havana, and the bluejackets seemed to me,
for the moment, to be American sailors in a foreign
port; and once, on the same evening's walk, when I
chanced to look to the westward across Marion Square,
I found myself transported to the central <i>place</i> of a Belgian
city, with a slope-shouldered church across the way
masquerading as a <i>h&ocirc;tel de ville</i>, and the sidewalk lights
at either side figuring in my imagination as those of
pleasant terrace caf&eacute;s. So it was always. The very
hotel in which we stayed&mdash;the Charleston&mdash;is like no
other hotel in the United States, though it has about it
something which caused me to think of the old Southern,
in St. Louis. Still, it is not like the Southern. It is
more like some old hotel in a provincial city of France&mdash;large
and white, with a pleasing unevenness of floor,
and, best of all, a great inner court which, in provincial
France, might be a <i>remise</i>, but is here a garden. If I
mistake not, carriages and coaches did in earlier times
drive through the arched entrance, now the main doorway,
and into this courtyard, where passengers alighted
and baggage was taken down. The Planter's Hotel,
now a ruin, opposite the Huguenot Church, antedates all
others in the city, and used to be the fashionable gathering
place for wealthy Carolinians and their families who
came to Charleston annually for the racing season.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that Charleston has a rather important art
museum and that its library is one of the four oldest
town libraries in the country, no less than the fact that
the city was, in its day, a great racing center, contribute
to an understanding of the spirit of the place. The
present Charleston Library is not the first public library
started in the city. Not by any means! For it was
founded as late as 1748, and the original public library
of Charleston was the first one of the kind in the country,
having been started about the beginning of the 18th
century. Old records of this library still exist, showing
that citizens voted so many skins to its support. Probably
the most valuable possession of the present library
are its files of Charleston newspapers, dating from 1732
to the present time, including three files covering the
War of 1812, and two covering the Civil War. These
files are consulted by persons from all over the United
States, for historical material. The library has recently
moved into a good modern building. In the old building
there was a separate entrance at the back for ladies,
and it is only lately that ladies have been allowed full
membership in the Library Society, and have entered by
the front door. The former custom, I suppose, represented
certain old-school sentiments as to "woman's
place" such as I find expressed in "Reminiscences of
Charleston," by Charles Fraser, published in 1854. Declares
Mr. Fraser:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The ambition for literary distinction is now very prevalent with
the sex. But without any disposition to undervalue their claims,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
whenever I hear of a female traveler clambering the Alps, or describing
the classic grounds of Greece and Italy, publishing her
musings in the holy land, or revealing the mysteries of the
harem, I cannot but think that for every success obtained some
appropriate duty has been neglected.</p>

<p>I except the poetess, for hers are the effusions of the heart and
the imagination, prompted by nature and uttered because they are
irrepressible. Many females travel for the purpose of writing
and publishing books&mdash;whilst Mrs. Heman's, Mrs. Osgood's, and
Mrs. Sigourney's volumes may be regarded as grateful offerings
to the muse in return for her inspiration.</p></div>

<p>It is hard not to be irritated, even now, with the man
who wrote that, especially in view of the fact that the
two most interesting books to come out of the Carolinas
of recent years are both by women: one of them being
"Charleston&mdash;the Place and the People," by Mrs. St.
Julien Ravenel, a volume any chapter of which is worth
the whole of Mr. Fraser's "Reminiscences," and the
other "A Woman Rice-Planter," by "Patience Pennington,"
otherwise Mrs. John Julius Pringle (n&eacute;e Alston),
who lives on her plantation near Georgetown, South
Carolina.</p>

<p>The Carolina Jockey Club subscribed regularly to the
support of the library, and now that that club is no more,
its chief memorial may be said to rest there. This club
was probably the first racing club in the country, and it
is interesting to note that the old cement pillars from
the Washington Race Course at Charleston were taken,
when that course was abandoned, and set up at the Belmont
Park course, near New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>The turf history of Carolina began (according to the
"South Carolina Gazette," dated February 1, 1734) in
that same year, on the first Tuesday in February. One
of the prizes was a saddle and bridle valued at &pound;20.
The riders were white men and the course was a green
at Charleston Neck, near where the lower depot of the
South Carolina Railroad now stands. In a "History of
the Turf in South Carolina," which I found in the
library, I learned that Mr. Daniel Ravenel bred fine
horses on his plantation, Wantoot, in St. John's Parish,
as early as 1761, that Mr. Frank Huger had imported
an Arabian horse, and that many other gentlemen were
importing British running horses, and were engaged in
breeding. The book refers to the old York Course, later
called the New Market Course. A long search did not,
however, enable me to establish the date on which the
Jockey Club was founded. It was clearly a going institution
in 1792, for under date of Wednesday, February
15, in that year, I found the record of a race for the
Jockey Club Purse&mdash;"four mile-heats&mdash;weight for age&mdash;won
by Mr. Lynch's <i>Foxhunter</i>, after a well contested
race of four heats, beating Mr. Sumter's <i>Ugly</i>, who won
the first heat; Col. Washington's <i>Rosetta</i>, who won the
second heat; Capt. Alston's <i>Betsy Baker</i>," etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Civil War practically ended the Jockey Club,
though a feeble effort was, for a time, made to carry it
on. In 1900 the club properties and the funds remaining
in the club treasury were transferred as an endowment
to the Charleston Library Society. The proceeds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
from this endowment add to the library's income by
about two thousand dollars annually. Other items of
interest in connection with the Carolina Jockey Club are
that Episcopal Church conventions used to be held in
Charleston during the racing season, so that the attending
parsons might take in the races; that the Jockey Club
Ball used to be the great ball of the Charleston season,
as the second St. Cecilia Ball became later and now is;
that the Charleston Club, a most delightful club, founded
in 1852, was an outgrowth of the Jockey Club; and that
the Jockey Club's old Sherries, Ports and Madeiras went
to New York where they were purchased by Delmonico&mdash;among
them a Calderon de la Barca Madeira of 1848,
and a Peter Domecq Sherry of 1818.</p>

<p>Mr. S.&nbsp;A. Nies, one of the old employees of Delmonico's,
tells me that the Calderon de la Barca of the
above mentioned year is all gone, but that Delmonico's
still has a few bottles of the same wine of the vintage
of 1851.</p>

<p>"This wine," Mr. Nies said, "is listed on our wine
card at $6.00 per bottle. It is not the best Madeira that
we have, although it is a very fine one. Recently we
served a bottle of Thompson's Auction Madeira, of
which the year is not recognizable on the label, but which
to my knowledge was an old wine forty years ago.
This wine brought $25.00 a bottle and was worth it.</p>

<p>"The Peter Domecq Sherry of 1818 does not figure
on our wine list as we have but a few bottles left. It
is $20.00 a bottle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"The prices brought to-day by old Madeiras and Sherries
do not represent their real values. One has but to
look at the compound interest of savings banks to realize
that these wines should be selling at four times the price
they are; but unfortunately, since the advent of Scotch
whisky in the American market, the American palate
seems to have deteriorated, and if the wines were listed
at the price they ought to bring, we could not sell them.
As it is, the demand for the very rare old wines is irregular
and infrequent. We keep them principally to preserve
our reputation; not for the money there is in it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Just now, when we are being unpleasantly awakened
to the fact that our vaunted American melting-pot
has not been doing its work; when some
of us are perhaps wondering whether the quality of
metal produced by the crucible will ever be of the best;
it is comforting to reflect that a city whose history, traditions
and great names are so completely involved with
Americanism in its highest forms, a city we think of as
ultra-American, is peculiarly a melting-pot product.</p>

<p>The original Charleston colonists were English and
Irish, sent out under Colonel Sayle, in 1669, by the
Lords Proprietors, to whom Charles II had granted a
tract of land in the New World, embracing the present
States of Georgia and North and South Carolina.
These colonists touched at Port Royal&mdash;where the
Marine Barracks now are (and ought not to be)&mdash;but
settled on the west side of the Ashley River, across from
where Charleston stands. It was not until 1680 that
they transferred their settlement to the present site
of the city, naming the place Charles Town in honor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of the King. In 1671 the colony contained 263 men
able to bear arms, 69 women and 59 children. In 1674,
when New York was taken by the English from the
Dutch, a number of the latter moved down to the Carolina
colony. French Protestants had, at that time,
already begun to arrive, and more came after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, in 1685. In 1680 Germans
came. By 1684 there were four Huguenot settlements
in Carolina. In 1696 a Quaker was governor
for a short time, and in the same year a body of New
Englanders arrived from Dorchester, Massachusetts,
establishing a town which they called Dorchester, near
the present town of Summerville, a few miles from
Charleston. At that time a number of Scottish immigrants
had already arrived, though more came in 1715
and 1745, after the defeat of the Highlanders. From
1730 to 1750 new colonists came from Switzerland, Holland
and Germany. As early as 1740 there were
several Jewish families in Charleston, and some of
the oldest and most respected Jewish families in the
United States still reside there. Also, when the English
drove the Acadians from Canada in 1755, twelve hundred
of them immigrated to Carolina. By 1790, then,
the city had a population of a little more than 15,000,
which was about half the number of inhabitants then
contained in the city of New York. In the case of
Charleston, however, more than one half her people, at
that time, were negroes, slavery having been introduced
by Sir John Yeamans, an early British governor. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
1850 the city had about 20,000 white citizens and 23,000
blacks, and by 1880 some 7,500 more, of which additional
number two thirds were negroes. The present population
is estimated at 65,000, which makes Charleston a
place of about the size of Rockford, Illinois, Sioux City,
Iowa, or Covington, Kentucky; but as, in the case of
Charleston, more than half this number is colored,
Charleston is, if the white population only is considered,
a place of approximately 30,000 inhabitants, or, roughly
speaking, about the size of Poughkeepsie, N.&nbsp;Y., or Colorado
Springs, Colorado.</p>

<p>In area, also, Charleston is small, covering less than
four square miles. This is due to the position of the
city on a peninsula formed by the convergence and confluence
of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which meet at
Charleston's beautiful Battery precisely as the Hudson
River and the East River meet at the Battery in New
York. The shape of Charleston, indeed, greatly resembles
that of Manhattan Island, and though her harbor
and her rivers are neither so large nor so deep as those
of the port of New York, they are altogether adequate
to a considerable maritime activity.</p>

<p>The Charleston Chamber of Commerce (which, like
everything else in Charleston dates from long ago, having
been founded in 1748) quotes President Taft as
calling this port the most convenient one to Panama&mdash;a
statement which the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce
is in position to dispute. The fact remains, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>ever,
that Charleston's position on the map justifies the
Chamber of Commerce's alliterative designation of the
place as "The Plumb-line Port to Panama." This is so
true that if Charleston should one day be shaken loose
from its moorings by an earthquake&mdash;something not unknown
there&mdash;and should fall due south upon the map,
it would choke up the mouth of the Canal, were not
Cuba interposed, to catch the debris.</p>

<p>Before the Civil War, Charleston was the greatest cotton
shipping port of the country, and it still handles
large amounts of cotton and rice. Until a few years ago
South Carolina was the chief rice producing State in
the Union, and history records that the first rice planted
in the Carolinas, if not in the country, was secured and
sown by an early governor of Carolina, Thomas Smith,
who died in 1694. It may be noted in passing that this
Thomas Smith bore the title "Landgrave," the Lords
Proprietors, in their plan of government for the colony&mdash;which,
by the way, was drawn up by the philosopher
Locke&mdash;having provided for a colonial nobility with
titles. The titles "Baron" and "Landgrave" were hereditary
in several Charleston families, and constitute,
so far as I know, the only purely American titles of
nobility that ever existed. Descendants of the old
Landgraves still reside in Charleston, and in at least one
instance continue to use the word "Landgrave" in connection
with the family name.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Charleston since the Civil War has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
depended more, perhaps, than on any other single product,
upon the trade in phosphate, large deposits of which
underlie this region.</p>

<p>The real wonder of Charleston, the importance of the
place among American cities, cannot, however, be said
to have resulted primarily from commerce (though her
commerce is growing), or from greatness of population
(though Charleston is the metropolis of the Carolinas),
but is involved with matters of history, tradition and
beauty. The mantle of greatness was assumed by this
city in colonial times, and has never been laid aside.
Among the most distinguished early Americans were
many Charlestonians, and in not a few instances the old
blood still endures there, and even the old names: such
names as Washington, Pinckney, Bull, Pringle, Rutledge,
Middleton, Drayton, Alston, Huger, Agassiz,
Ravenel, Izard, Gadsden, Rhett, Calhoun, Read, De
Saussure, Lamar and Brawley, to mention but a few.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Charleston's early history is rich in pirate stories of
the most thrilling moving-picture variety. Blackbeard,
Stede Bonnet and other disciples of the Jolly Roger
preyed upon Charleston shipping. Bonnet once held a
Mr. Samuel Wragg of Charleston prisoner aboard his
ship threatening to send his head to the city unless the
unfortunate man should be ransomed&mdash;the demand being
for medicines of various kinds. Colonel Rhett, of
Charleston, captured Bonnet and his ship after a savage
fight, but Bonnet soon after escaped from the city in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
woman's clothing. Still later he was retaken, hanged,
as he deserved to be, and buried along with forty of his
band at a point now covered by the Battery Garden, that
exquisite little park at the tip of the city, which is the
favorite promenade of Charlestonians. In another
fight which occurred just off Charleston bar, a crew of
citizens under Governor Robert Johnson defeated the
pirate Richard Worley, who was killed in the action, and
captured his ship, which, when the hatches were opened
proved to be full of prisoners, thirty-six of them women.
Even as late as the period of the War of 1812&mdash;a war
which did not affect Charleston save in the way of destroying
her shipping and causing poverty and distress&mdash;a
case of brutal piracy is recorded. The daughter of
Aaron Burr, Theodosia by name, was married to Governor
Joseph Alston. After her father's trial for high
treason, when he was disgraced and broken, she tried to
comfort him, for the two were peculiarly devoted. Intending
to visit him she set sail from Charleston for
New York in a ship which was never heard from again.
Somewhere I have read a description of the distraught
father's long vigils at New York, where he would stand
gazing out to sea long after all hope had been abandoned
by others. Mrs. St. Julien Ravenel tells us in her charming
book, that thirty years later an old sailor, dying in a
village of the North Carolina coast, confessed that he
had been one of a pirate crew which had captured the
ship and compelled the passengers to walk the plank.
This story is also given by Charles Gayarr&eacute;, who says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the pirate chief was none other than Dominick You,
who fought under Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans,
and is buried in that city. The husband and father
of Mrs. Alston were spared the ghastly tale, Mrs. Ravenel
says, since both were already in their graves
when the sailor's deathbed confession solved the mystery.</p>

<p>In the Revolution, Charleston played an important
part. Men of Charleston were, of course, among the
signers of the Declaration of Independence. Charles
Cotesworth Pinckney, who gave us the immortal maxim:
"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!"
who was on Washington's staff, was later Ambassador
to France and president-general of the Sons of the Cincinnati,
was a Charlestonian of the Charlestonians, and
lies buried in St. Michael's. Such Revolutionary names
as Marion, Laurens, William Washington, Greene,
Hampton, Moultrie and Sumter are associated with the
place, and two of these are re&euml;choed in the names of
those famous forts in Charleston harbor on which attention
was fixed at the outbreak of the Civil War:
Moultrie and Sumter&mdash;the latter, target for the first
shot fired in the conflict.</p>

<p>Nearly thirty years before the Civil War, Charleston
had distinguished herself in the arts of peace by producing
the first locomotive tried in the United States, and by
constructing the first consecutive hundred miles of railroad
ever built in the world, and now, with the War,
she distinguished herself by initiating other mechanical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
devices of very different character&mdash;a semi-submersible
torpedo boat and the first submarine to torpedo a hostile
war vessel. True, David Bushnell of Connecticut
did construct a crude sort of submarine during the Revolutionary
War, and succeeded in getting under a British
ship with the machine, but he was unable to fasten
his charge of powder and his effort consequently failed.
Robert Fulton also experimented with submarines, or
"plunging boats" as he called them, and was encouraged
for a time by Napoleon I. The little <i>David</i> of the Confederate
navy is sometimes referred to as the first submarine
but the <i>David</i> was not actually an underwater
boat, but a torpedo boat which could run awash, with her
funnels and upper works slightly out of water. She
was a cigar-shaped vessel thirty-three feet long, built of
wood, propelled by steam, and carrying her torpedo on
a pole, forward. Dr. St. Julien Ravenel of Charleston
and Captain Theodore Stoney devised the craft, and she
was built by funds subscribed by Charleston merchants.
In command of Lieutenant W.&nbsp;T. Glassell, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., and
with three other men aboard, she torpedoed the United
States ship <i>New Ironsides</i>, flagship of the fleet blockading
Charleston. The <i>New Ironsides</i> was crippled, but
not lost. After this United States vessels blockading
Charleston protected themselves with booms. This resulted
in the construction of an actual undersea torpedo
boat, the <i>Hunley</i>. This extraordinary vessel has been
spoken of as having had the appearance of a huge iron
coffin, as well as the attributes of one, for she proved a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
death-trap for successive crews on three trial trips. As
there were no electric motors or gasoline engines in those
days, she was run by hand, eight men crowded together
turning a crank-shaft which operated her propeller.
After repeated sinkings, she was raised, manned by new
men, and sent forth again. Finally, in Charleston harbor
she succeeded in destroying the United States man-o'-war
<i>Housatonic</i>, but at the same time went down, herself,
drowning or suffocating all on board. A memorial
drinking fountain on the Battery, at the foot of Meeting
Street, commemorates "the men of the Confederate
Army and Navy, first in marine warfare to employ torpedo
boats&mdash;1863-1865." On this memorial are given
the names of sixteen men who perished in torpedo attacks
on the blockading fleet, among them Horace L. Hunley,
set down as inventor of the submarine boat. The
names of fourteen others who were lost are unknown.</p>

<p>Lord William Campbell, younger son of the Duke of
Argyll, was British governor at Charleston when the
Revolution broke out. He had married a Miss Izard, of
Charleston, who brought him a dowry of fifty thousand
pounds, a large sum in those times. Their home was in
a famous old house which stands on Meeting Street, and
it was from the back yard of this house that Lord William
fled in a rowboat to a British man-o'-war, when it
became evident that Charleston was no longer hospitable
to representatives of the Crown. Later his wife followed
him to Great Britain, where they remained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pringle House, as it is now called, formerly the
Brewton house, perhaps the most superb old residence in
the city, was the headquarters of General Sir Henry
Clinton, after he had captured Charleston, and was the
residence of Lord Rawdon, the unpleasant British commander
who succeeded Clinton. Cornwallis lived outside
the town at Drayton Hall, which still stands, on the
Ashley River. After his capture Cornwallis was exchanged
for Henry Laurens, a distinguished Charlestonian,
who, though he wept over the Declaration of Independence,
was before long president of the Continental
Congress, and later went to France, where he was
associated with Benjamin Franklin, John Jay and John
Adams in negotiating the treaty of peace and independence
for America.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravenel says in her book that Sherman destroyed
all but one of the superb old houses on the
Ashley River, and when we consider that Sherman's
troops invested Charleston just before the end of the
War, and reflect upon the general's notorious "carelessness
with fire," we have cause for national rejoicing that
Charleston, with its unmatched buildings and their
splendid contents, was not laid in ashes, as were Atlanta
and Columbia. Had Sherman burned Charleston it
would be hard for even a Yankee to forgive him.</p>

<p>Even without the aid of the Northern general, the
city has been able to furnish disastrous conflagrations
of her own, over a period of two centuries and more,
and I find in the quaint reminiscences of Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Fraser, already alluded to, a lamentation that, because
of fires, many of the old landmarks have disappeared,
and the city is "losing its look of picturesque
antiquity." To make matters worse, there came, in
1886, an earthquake, rendering seven eighths of the
houses uninhabitable until repairs aggregating some millions
of dollars had been made. Up to the time of the
earthquake the old mansion from which Lord William
Campbell fled at the beginning of the Revolution, was
adorned by a battlemented roof. It is recorded that
when the shock came, an Englishman was in the house,
and that in his eagerness to get outdoors he pushed
others aside. As he reached the front steps, however,
the battlements came crashing down. He was the one
person from that house who perished, and his only monument
is the patch of comparatively new stone where the
broken steps have been repaired.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My companion and I achieved entrance to one of the
famous old Charleston houses which we had been particularly
anxious to see, through the kindness of a lady
to whom we had a letter of introduction, who happened
to be a relative of the owner of the house.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to explain, at this juncture, that in
Charleston, many proper names of foreign origin have
been corrupted in pronunciation. A few examples will
suffice: The Dutch name Vanderhorst, conspicuous in
the early annals of the city, has come to be pronounced
"Van-Dross"; Legar&eacute;, the name of another distin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>guished
old family, commemorated in the name of Legar&eacute;
Street, is pronounced "Legree"; De Saussure has
become "Dess-a-sore," with the accent on the first syllable,
and Prioleau is called "Pray-low."</p>

<p>I was unaware of these matters when my companion
and I visited the ancient house I speak of. Though I
had heard the name of the proprietor of the mansion
spoken many times, and recognized it as a distinguished
Charleston name, I had never seen it written; however,
without having given the matter much thought, I had,
unfortunately, reached my own conclusions as to how
it was spelled. Still more unfortunately, while I was
delighting in the drawing-room of that wonderful old
house, with the portraits of ladies in powdered hair and
men in cocked hats and periwigs looking down upon
me from the walls, I was impelled to reassure myself
as to the spelling of the name. Let us assume that the
name sounded like "Bowfee." That was not it but it
will suffice for illustration.</p>

<p>"I suppose," I said to our charming cicerone, "that the
family name is spelled 'B-o-w-f-e-e'?"</p>

<p>I had no sooner spoken than I realized, with a sudden
access of horror what I had done. In guessing I
had sinned, but in guessing wrong I had ruined myself.
All this came to me instantly and positively, as by a
psychic message of unparalleled definiteness from the
dead ancestors whose portraits hung upon the paneling.
It was as though they had joined in a great ghostly shout
of execration, which was the more awful because it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
a silent shout that jarred upon the senses rather than
the ear drums. Then, before the lady replied, while
the sound of my own voice saying "B-o-w-f-e-e"
seemed to reverberate through the apartment, I suddenly
comprehended the spirit of Charleston: understood
that, compared with Charleston, Boston is as a
rough mining camp, while New York hardly exists at
all, being a mere miasma of vulgarity.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, in which the lady to whom
I had spoken gazed from the window at the rainy twilight.
Her silence, I am persuaded, was not intended to
rebuke me; she was not desirous of crushing me; she
was merely stunned. Indeed, when at last she spoke,
there was in her tone something of gentleness.</p>

<p>"The name," she said, "is Beaufoy&mdash;B-e-a-u-f-o-y.
It is of Huguenot origin."</p>

<p>Passionately I wished for an earthquake&mdash;one that
might cause the floor to open beneath me, or the roof to
fall through and blot me from her sight. How to get
away?&mdash;that was my one thought. To cover my embarrassment,
I tried to make small-talk about a medallion
of an Emperor of France, which hung upon the
paneling. The lady said it had been given to an ancestor
of the Beaufoys by the Emperor himself. That,
for some reason, seemed to make things rather worse.
I wished I had not dragged the Emperor into the conversation.</p>

<p>"It is getting dark," I said. "It is time we were going."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>This the lady did not dispute.</p>

<p>Of our actual farewells and exit from that house, I
remember not a detail, save that, as we departed, I knew
that we should never see this lady again; that for her
I no longer existed, and that in my downfall I had
dragged my companion with me. The next thing I
definitely recollect is walking swiftly up Meeting Street
beside him, in the rain and darkness of late afternoon.
All the way back to the hotel we strode side by side in
pregnant silence; neither did we speak as we ascended
to our rooms.</p>

<p>Some time later, while I was dressing for dinner, he
entered my bedchamber. At the moment, as it happened,
I was putting cuff-links into a dress shirt. With
this task I busied myself, dreading to look up. In the
meantime I felt his eyes fixed upon me. When the
links were in, I delayed meeting his gaze by buttoning
the little button in one sleeve-vent, above the cuff.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you button those idiotic little
buttons?" he demanded. "I didn't know that anybody
ever did that!"</p>

<p>"I don't always," I answered apologetically.</p>

<p>"I should hope not!" he returned. Then he continued:
"Do you remember where we are to be taken
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "To the Pringle house."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I just came in to ask you, as a
favor, not to get off any fanciful ideas that you may
have thought up, about the way to spell Pringle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<br />
POLITICS, A NEWSPAPER AND ST. CECILIA</h2>


<p>Charleston is very definitely a part of South
Carolina. That is not always the case with a
State and its chief city. It is not the case with
the State and the City of New York. New York City
has about the same relation to New York State as a
goldpiece has to a large table-top on one corner of which
it lies. Charleston, on the other hand, harmonizes into
its state setting, as a beautiful ancient vase harmonizes
into the setting afforded by some rare old cabinet.
Moreover, Charleston's individuality amongst cities is
more or less duplicated in South Carolina's individuality
amongst States. South Carolina is a State as definitely
marked&mdash;though in altogether different ways&mdash;as Kansas
or California. It is a State that does nothing by
halves. It has rattlesnakes larger and more venomous
than other rattlesnakes, and it has twice had the disgraceful
Cole Blease, otherwise "To-hell-with-the-Constitution"
Blease, as governor. For senator it has the
old war-horse Tillman, a man so admired for his power
that, in our easy-going way, we almost forgive his
dives into the pork-barrel. Tillman has been to South
Carolina more or less what the late Senator Hale
was to his section of New England. Hale grabbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
a navy yard for Kittery, Maine (the Portsmouth
yard), where there never should have been a navy yard;
Tillman performed a like service, under like circumstances,
for Charleston. Both are purely political yards.
Naval officers opposed them, but were overridden by politicians,
as so often happens. For in time of peace the
army and the navy are political footballs, and it is only
when war comes that the politicians cease kicking them
about and cry: "Now, football, turn into a cannon-ball,
and save your country and your country's flag!" For
obviously, if the flag cannot be saved, the politicians will
be without a "starry banner" to gesture at and roar
about.</p>

<p>Now, of course, with war upon us, any navy yard is a
blessing, and the Charleston yard is being used, as it
should be, to the utmost. But in time of peace the yard
comes in for much criticism from the navy, the contention
being that it is not favorably located from a strategic
point of view, and that, owing to bars in the Cooper
River, up which it is situated, it cannot be entered by
large ships. The point is also made that while labor is
cheaper at this yard than at any other, skilled metal-workers
are hard to get. Friends of the yard contend,
upon the other hand, that it is desirable because of its
convenience to the Caribbean Sea, where, according to
naval theory, this country will some day have to fight a
battle in defense of the Panama Canal. The Pensacola
yard, it is pointed out, is exposed and can be bombarded,
whereas the Charleston yard is far enough inland to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
safe from sea attack. As to the channel, it is navigable
for destroyers and other small craft&mdash;though whether it
would be so to a large destroyer which had been injured
and was drawing more water than usual, I do not know.
The practical situation of the navy, with regard to this
and some of the other political yards, is like that of some
man who has been left a lot of heterogeneous houses,
scattered about town, none of them suited to his purposes,
and who is obliged to scatter his family amongst
them as best he can, or else abandon them and build a
new house. We have been following the former course,
and are only now preparing to adopt the latter, by establishing
a naval base at Norfolk, as mentioned in an
earlier chapter.</p>

<p>Charleston politics have been peculiar. Until a few
years ago the government of the city had long rested in
the hands of a few old families, among them the Gadsdens
and the Rhetts. The overthrow of this ancient and
aristocratic rule by the election to the mayoralty of John
P. Grace, an alleged "friend of the people," was
spoken of by the New York "Sun," as being not a mere
change in municipal government, but the fall of a
dynasty which had controlled the city politically, financially
and socially for a century and a half. Mr. Grace
may be dismissed with the remark that he supported
Blease and that he is editor of the recently founded
Charleston "American," which I have heard called a
Hearst newspaper, and which certainly wears the Hearst
look about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 19, 1917, this newspaper printed a full
account of the ball of the St. Cecilia Society, Charleston's
most sacred social organization. Never before in
the history of the St. Cecilia Society, covering a period
of a century and a half, had an account of one of its
balls, and the names of those attending, been printed.
The publication caused a great stir in the city and resulted
in an editorial, said to have been written by Grace,
which appeared next day, and which reveals something
of Charleston tradition and something of Grace, as well.
It was headed "The Saint Cecilia Ball," and ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We carried on yesterday a full account of the famous Saint
Cecilia Ball. From the foundation of Charleston until the present
moment it has been regarded as an unwritten law that the
annual events of this ancient society shall not be touched upon.</p>

<p>Of course it was permissible for the thirty-five thousand poor
white people of Charleston to talk about the Saint Cecilia, and
to indulge in the thrilling sensation that comes to the proverbial
cat when she looks at a queen. Some of them, moved by curiosity,
even ventured within half a block of the Hibernian Hall
to observe from afar the gay festivities.</p>

<p>The press being forbidden to cover Saint Cecilia events, there
grew up in the vulgar mind weird stories of what went on behind
the scenes. While the Saint Cecilia has enjoyed the happy
privilege of journalistic silence, it has, therefore, correspondingly
suffered on the tongue of gossip. The truth is that we always
knew that the Saint Cecilia was just about the same as
every other social collection of human beings&mdash;a little gaiety flavored
with a little frivolity; nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>There was a time when this society was the extreme limit of
social exclusiveness. It was an anachronism on American soil,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
a matter of pure heredity, the right to membership in which was as
fixed as Median law, but transcendently above the median line.
Now, however, since the society, in keeping with the spirit of
the age, has relaxed its rules to admit from year to year (if, indeed,
only a few now and then) members whose blood is far
from indigo, we think it perfectly legitimate for the newspaper,
which represents <span class="smcap">all</span> classes of people, to invade the quondam
sanctity of its functions which are now being <span class="smcap">opened</span> to all
classes.</p></div>

<p>Following this, the editorial quoted from Don Seitz's
book, telling how the elder James Gordon Bennett was
in the habit of mocking "events to which he was not invited,"
and how, in 1840, he managed to get one of his
reporters into "Henry I Brevoort's fancy dress ball, the
social event of the period." The quotation from Mr.
Seitz's book ends with the following: "A far cry from
this to 1894, when Ward McAlister, arbiter of the '400'
at Mrs. Astor's famous ball, became a leader on social
topics for the New York 'World.' It took many years
for this umbrage at the reporting of social events to wear
off and make the reporter welcome. Indeed, there is one
place yet on the map where it is not even now permitted
to record a social event, though the editors and owners
of papers may be among those present. That is Charleston,
South Carolina...."</p>

<p>The Charleston editor then resumes his own reflections
in this wise:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We regret to say, and it is the regret of our life, that we were
not one of the editors present at the Saint Cecilia. This, therefore,
relieves us of the implied condition to adhere any longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
to this silly and absurd custom which, in the language of this
great newspaper man, has made its last stand "on the map" at
Charleston. We are glad that we have forever nailed, in the
opinion of one hundred million ordinary people who make the
American nation, the absurdity that there is any social event so
sacred, any people so DIFFERENT from the rest of us poor human
beings, that we dare not speak of them.</p></div>

<p>Just why private social events should be, as Mr. Grace
seems to assume, particularly the property of the press,
it is somewhat difficult to explain, unless we do so by
accepting as fundamental the theory that the press is
justified in invading personal privacy purely in order to
pander, on the one hand to the new breed of vulgar rich
which thrives on "publicity," and on the other, to the
breed of vulgar poor which enjoys reading that supremest
of American inanities, the "society page."</p>

<p>What Mr. Seitz said in his book as to the reticence of
Charleston newspapers, where society is concerned, is,
however, generally true&mdash;amazingly so to one who has
become hardened to the attitude of the metropolitan press
elsewhere. The society columns of Charleston papers
hardly ever print the names of the city's real aristocrats,
and in the past they have gone much farther than this,
for they have been known to suppress important news
stories in which prominent citizens were unpleasantly
involved. It may be added that earthquakes are evidently
classed as members of the aristocracy, since occasional
tremors felt in the city are pointedly ignored by
the press. Whether or not the paper edited by the fear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>less
Mr. Grace ignores these manifestations I am unable
to say. One can easily fancy his taking a courageous
stand on such a subject as well as upon social matters.
Indeed, with a few slight changes, his editorial upon
the St. Cecilia ball, might be made to serve equally well
after an earthquake shock. He might say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The press being forbidden to cover earthquakes, there grew
up in the vulgar mind weird stories of what went on behind the
scenes. While the earthquakes have enjoyed the happy privilege
of journalistic silence, they have, therefore, correspondingly
suffered on the tongue of gossip.</p></div>

<p>He could also make the point that since, "in keeping
with the spirit of the age," the earthquake shakes people
"(if indeed only a few of them now and then), whose
blood is far from indigo, we think it perfectly legitimate
for the newspaper, which represents ALL classes of people,
to invade the quondam sanctity of its functions
which are now being OPENED to all classes."</p>

<p>But of course, where the editor of such a paper is
concerned, there is always the element of natural delicacy
and nicety of feeling to be considered. Mr. Grace
felt that because he was not present at the St. Cecilia
ball, he was free to print things about it. An earthquake
would not be like the St. Cecilia Society&mdash;it would
not draw the line at Mr. Grace. At a Charleston earthquake
he would undoubtedly be present. The question
therefore arises: Having been PRESENT, might his
AMOUR PROPRE make him feel that to REPORT
the event would not be altogether in GOOD TASTE?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>The St. Cecilia Society began in 1737 with a concert
given on St. Cecilia's day, and continued for many years
to give concerts at which the musicians were both amateurs
and professionals. Josiah Quincy, in his "Journal,"
tells of having attended one of these concerts in
1773, and speaks of the richness of the men's apparel,
noting that there were "many with swords on."</p>

<p>When, in 1819, difficulty was experienced in obtaining
performers, it was proposed that a ball be held in place
of a concert, and by 1822 the society was definitely transformed
from a musical to a dancing organization, which
it has remained ever since.</p>

<p>The statement in the "American" editorial that St.
Cecilia balls have been the subject of scandalous gossip
is, I believe, quite false, as is also the statement that the
balls are now "being opened to all classes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravenel in her book tells how the organization
is run. Members are elected, and all are men, though
the names of the ladies of a member's household are
placed on the club list. "Only death or removal from
the city erases them&mdash;change of fortune affects them not
at all." A man whose progenitors have belonged to the
society is almost certain of election, though there have
been cases in which undesirables of good family have
been blackballed. Two blackballs are sufficient to cause
the rejection of a candidate. Men who are not of old
Charleston stock are carefully investigated before they
can be elected, but of late years not a few such, having
been considered desirable, have become members. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
members elect officers and a board of managers, and
these have entire control of the society. Three balls are
given each year, one in January and two in February.
Until a few years ago the hall in which the balls are given
was lighted by innumerable candelabra; only lately has
electricity been used. The society owns its own plate,
damask, china and glassware, and used to own a good
stock of wines. Of late years, I believe, wines have not
been served, the beverage of the evening consisting of
coffee, hot and iced. The greatest decorum is observed
at the balls. Young ladies go invariably with chaperones;
following each dance there is a brief promenade,
whereafter the young ladies are returned to their duennas&mdash;who,
if they be Charleston dowagers in perfection,
usually carry turkey-feather fans. Cards are filled
months in advance. As lately as the year 1912 every
other dance was a square dance; since then, however, I
believe that square dances have gone the way of candle-light.
The society has an endowment and membership
is inexpensive, costing but fifteen dollars a year, including
the three balls. This enables young men starting
in life to be members without going into extravagance,
and is in accord with the best social tradition of Charleston,
where the difference between an aristocracy and a
plutocracy is well understood. Most of the rules of the
organization are unwritten. One is that men shall not
smoke on the premises during a ball; another is that divorced
persons shall not be members or guests of the
society. In this respect the St. Cecilia Society may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
said, in effect, to be applying, socially, the South Carolina
law; for South Carolina is the only State in the Union
in which divorces are not granted for any cause whatsoever.</p>

<p>This reminds me that the State has an anti-tipping
law. The Pullman porter is required to hang up copies
of the law in his car when it enters South Carolina, and
copies of it are displayed on the doors of hotel bedrooms.
The penalty for giving or receiving a tip is a fine of from
ten to one hundred dollars, or thirty days in jail. Perhaps
the law is observed. I know, at least, that no one
offered me a tip while I was in that State.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The old grandees of Charleston were usually sent to
Oxford or Cambridge for an education and English tradition
still remains, I fancy, the foundation for what
Charleston social life is to-day. I thought at first that
Charlestonians spoke like the English, but later came to
the conclusion that there is in the pronunciation of some
of them a quality resembling a very faint brogue&mdash;a
brogue such as might be possessed by a cultivated Irishman
who had moved to England in his boyhood, and had
been educated there. The "vanishing <i>y</i>" of tidewater
Virginia is also used by some Charlestonians, I am told,
though I do not remember hearing it.</p>

<p>Generalizations on the subject of dialectic peculiarities
are dangerous, as I have good reason to know. Naturally,
not all Charlestonians speak alike. I should say,
however, that the first <i>a</i> in the words "Papa" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
"Mama" is frequently given a short sound, as <i>a</i> in
"hat"; also that many one-syllable words are strung out
into two. For instance, "eight" is heard as "ay-et"
("ay" as in "gray"); "where" as "whey-uh," or
"way-uh," and "hair" as "hay-uh." "Why?" sometimes
sounds like "Woi?" Such words as "calm" and "palm"
are sometimes given the short <i>a</i>: "cam" and "pam"&mdash;which,
of course, occurs elsewhere, too. The name
"Ralph" is pronounced as "Rafe" (<i>a</i> as in "rate")&mdash;which
I believe is Old English; and the names "Saunders"
and "Sanders" are pronounced exactly alike, both
being called "Sanders." Tomatoes are sometimes called
"tomatters." Two dishes I never heard of before are
"Hopping John," which is rice cooked with peas, and
"Limping Kate," which is some other rice combination.
What we, in the North, call an "ice-cream freezer" becomes
in Charleston an "ice-cream <i>churn</i>." "Good
morning" is the salutation up to three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, whereas in
other parts of the South "Good evening" is said for the
Northern "Good afternoon." Charlestonians speak of
being "parrot-toed"&mdash;not "pigeon-toed." Where, in the
North, we would ask a friend, "How are things out your
way?" a Charlestonian may inquire, "How are things
out your <i>side</i>?" The expression "going out" means to
go to St. Cecilia Balls, and I have been told that it is
never used in any other way. That is, if a lady is asked:
"Are you going out this winter?" it means definitely,
"Are you going to the St. Cecilia balls?" If you heard
it said that some one was "<i>on</i> Mount Pleasant," you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
might suppose that Mount Pleasant was an island; but
it is not; it is a village on the mainland across the Cooper
River. And what is to me one of the most curious expressions
I ever heard is "do don't," as when a lady
called to her daughter, "Martha, <i>do</i> don't slam that door
again!"</p>

<p>How generally these peculiarities crop out in the
speech of Charleston I cannot say. It occurs to me,
however, that, assembled and catalogued in this way,
they may create the idea that slovenly English is generally
spoken in the city. If so they give an impression
which I should not wish to convey, since Charleston has
no more peculiarities of language than New York or
Boston, and not nearly so many as a number of other
cities. Cultivated Charlestonians have, moreover, the
finest voices I have heard in any American city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<br />
"GULLA" AND THE BACK COUNTRY</h2>


<p>The most extraordinary negro dialect I know of
is the "gulla" (sometimes spelled "gullah") of
the rice plantation negroes of South Carolina
and of the islands off the South Carolina and Georgia
coast. I believe that the region of Charleston is headquarters
for "gulla niggers," though I have heard the
argot spoken as far south as Sepeloe Island, off the town
of Darien, Georgia, near the Florida line. Gulla is such
an extreme dialect as to be almost a language by itself.
Whence it came I do not know, but I judge that it is a
combination of English with the primitive tongues of
African tribes, just as the dialect of old Creole negroes,
in Louisiana, is a combination of African tribal tongues
with French.</p>

<p>A Charleston lady tells me that negroes on different
rice plantations&mdash;even on adjoining plantations&mdash;speak
dialects which differ somewhat, and I know of my own
knowledge that thick gulla is almost incomprehensible
to white persons who have not learned, by long practice,
to understand it.</p>

<p>A lady sent a gulla negro with a message to a friend.
This is the message as it was delivered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Missis seh all dem turrah folk done come shum.
Enty you duh gwine come shum?" (To get the gulla
effect the sounds should be uttered very rapidly.)</p>

<p>Translated, this means: "Mistress says all them other
folks have come to see her. Aren't you coming to see
her?"</p>

<p>"Shum" is a good gulla word. It means all kinds of
things having to do with seeing&mdash;<i>to see her</i>, <i>to see him</i>,
<i>to see it</i>. Thus, "You shum, enty?" may mean, <i>You
see him</i>&mdash;<i>her</i>&mdash;or <i>it</i>? or <i>You see what he</i>&mdash;<i>she</i>&mdash;or <i>it</i>&mdash;<i>is
doing</i>, or <i>has done</i>? For gulla has no genders and
no tenses. "Enty" is a general question: <i>Aren't you?
Didn't you? Isn't it?</i> etc. Another common gulla
word is "Buckra" which means <i>a white man of the
upper class</i>, in contradistinction to a poor white. I have
known a negro to refer to "de frame o' de bud," meaning
the carcass, or frame, of a fowl. "Ay ain' day"
means "They aren't (ain't) there."</p>

<p>A friend of mine who resided at Bluffton, South
Carolina, has told me of an old gulla fisherman who
spoke in parables.</p>

<p>A lady would ask him: "Have you any fish to-day?"
To which, if replying affirmatively, he would answer:
"Missis, de gate open"; meaning, "The door (of the
'car,' or fish-box) is open to you." If he had no fish he
would reply: "Missis, ebb-tide done tack (take) crick";
signifying: "The tide has turned and it is too late to go
to catch fish." This old man called whisky "muhgundy
smash," the term evidently derived from some idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the word "burgundy" combined with the word "mash."</p>

<p>Here is a gulla dialect story, with a line-for-line translation.
A train has killed a cow, and a negro witness
is being examined by a justice of the peace:</p>

<p>Mrs. Leiding (Harriette Kershaw Leiding), of
Charleston, has done a fine service to lovers of Old
Charleston, and its ways, in collecting and publishing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
pamphlet form a number of the cries of the negro street
vendors. Of these I shall rob Mrs. Leiding's booklet
of but one example&mdash;the cry of a little negro boy, a peddler
of shrimp ("swimp"), who stood under a window
in the early morning and sang:</p>

<p>While on the subject of the Charleston negro I must
not neglect two of his superstitions. One is his belief
that a two-dollar bill is unlucky. The curse may be removed
only by tearing off a corner of the bill. The
other is that it is unlucky to hand any one a pin. A
Charleston lady told me that when she was motoring
and wished to pin her hat or her veil, she could never
get her negro chauffeur to hand her pins. Instead he
would stick them in the laprobe, or in the sleeve of his
coat, whence she could pick them out herself. Another
lady told me of the case of an old black slave who lived
years ago on a plantation on the Santee River, owned
by her family. This slave, who was a very powerful,
taciturn and high-tempered man, had a curious habit of
disappearing for about half an hour each day. He
would go into the swamp, and for many years no one
ever followed him, the other negroes being afraid to do
so because of his temper and his strength. At last,
however, they did spy upon him and discovered that in
the swamp there stood a cypress tree on which were
strange rude carvings, before which he prostrated him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>self.
No one ever learned the exact significance of
this, but it was assumed that the man practised some
barbaric form of worship, brought from Africa.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The country back of Charleston is very lovely and is
rich in interest, even though most of the houses on the
old estates have been destroyed. Drayton Hall, however,
stands, and the old Drayton estate, Magnolia, not
far distant from the Hall (which was on another estate),
has one of the most famous gardens in the world.
Seven persons touching fingertips can barely encircle the
trunks of some of the live-oaks at Magnolia; there are
camellias more than twenty feet high, and a rose tree
nearly as large, but the great glory of the garden is
its huge azaleas&mdash;ninety-two varieties, it is said&mdash;which,
when they blossom in the spring, are so wonderful that
people make long journeys for no other purpose than to
see them.</p>

<p>In "Harper's Magazine" for December, 1875, I find
an account of the gardens which were, at that time, far
from new. The azaleas were then twelve and thirteen
feet tall; now, I am told, they reach to a height of more
than twenty feet, with a corresponding spread.</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible," says the anonymous writer
of the article, "to give a Northerner any idea of the
affluence of color in this garden when its flowers are in
bloom. Imagine a long walk with the moss-draped live-oaks
overhead, a fairy lake and a bridge in the distance,
and on each side the great fluffy masses of rose and pink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and crimson, reaching far above your head, thousands
upon tens of thousands of blossoms packed close together,
with no green to mar the intensity of their color,
rounding out in swelling curves of bloom down to the
turf below, not pausing a few inches above it and showing
bare stems or trunk, but spreading over the velvet,
and trailing out like the rich robes of an empress.
Stand on one side and look across the lawn; it is like a
mad artist's dream of hues; it is like the Arabian nights;
eyes that have never had color enough find here a full
feast, and go away satisfied at last. And with all their
gorgeousness, the hues are delicately mingled; the magic
effect is produced not by unbroken banks of crude reds,
but by blended shades, like the rich Oriental patterns of
India shawls, which the European designers, with all
their efforts, can never imitate."</p>

<p>Another remarkable garden, though not the equal of
Magnolia, is at Middleton Place, not many miles away,
and still another is at the pleasant winter resort town of
Summerville, something more than twenty miles above
Charleston. The latter, called the Pinehurst Tea Garden,
is said to be the only tea garden in the United
States. It is asserted that the teas produced here are
better than those of China and Japan, and are equal to
those of India. The Government is co&ouml;perating with
the owners of this garden with a view to introducing tea
planting in the country in a large way.</p>

<p>The finest grade of tea raised here is known as "Shelter
Tea," and is sold only at the gardens, the price being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
five dollars per pound. It is a tea of the Assam species
grown under shelters of wire mesh and pine straw.
This type of tea is known in Japan, where it originated,
as "sugar tea," because, owing to the fact that it is grown
in the shade, the sap of the bush, which is of starchy
quality, is turned chemically into sugar, giving the leaf
an exceedingly delicate flavor.</p>

<p>From the superintendent in charge of the gardens I
learned something of the bare facts of the tea growing
industry. I had always been under the impression that
the name "pekoe" referred to a certain type of tea, but
he told me that the word is Chinese for "eyelash," and
came to be used because the tip leaves of tea bushes,
when rolled and dried, resemble eyelashes. These
leaves&mdash;"pekoe tips"&mdash;make the most choice tea. The
second leaves make the tea called "orange pekoe," while
the third leaves produce a grade of tea called simply
"pekoe." In China it is customary to send three groups
of children, successively, to pick the leaves, the first
group picking only the tips, the second group the second
leaves, and the third group the plain pekoe leaves. At
the Pinehurst Tea Gardens the picking is done by colored
children, ranging from eight to fifteen years of age.
All the leaves are picked together and are later separated
by machinery.</p>

<p>Summerville itself seems a lovely lazy town. It is
the kind of place to which I should like to retire in the
winter if I had a book to write. One could be very comfortable,
and there would be no radical distractions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>&mdash;unless
one chanced to see the Most Beautiful Girl in the
World, who has been known to spend winters at that
place.</p>

<p>On the way from Charleston to Summerville, if you
go by motor, you pass The Oaks, an estate with a new
colonial house standing where an ancient mansion used
to stand. A long avenue bordered by enormous live-oaks,
leading to this house, gives the place its name, and
affords a truly noble approach. Here, in Revolutionary
times, Marion, "the Swamp Fox," used to camp.</p>

<p>Not far distant from the old gate at The Oaks is Goose
Creek Church&mdash;the most interesting church I have ever
seen. The Parish of St. James, Goose Creek, was established
by act of the Assembly, November 30, 1706,
and the present church, a brick building of crudely simple
architecture, was built about 1713. The interior of
the church, though in good condition, is the oldest looking
thing, I think, in the United States. The memorial
tablets in the walls, with their foreign names and antique
lettering, the curious old box pews, the odd little gallery
at the back, the tall pulpit, with its winding stair, above
all the Royal Arms of Great Britain done in relief on
the chancel wall and brilliantly colored&mdash;all these make
Goose Creek Church more like some little Norman
church in England, than like anything one might reasonably
expect to find on this side of the world.</p>

<span class="caption">The interior is the oldest looking thing in the United States&mdash;Goose Creek Church</span>
</div>

<p>Countless items of curious interest hang about the
church and parish. Michaux, the French botanist who
came to this country in 1786, lived for a time at Goose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Creek. He brought with him the first four camellias
seen in the United States, planting them at Middleton
Place above Drayton Hall, where, I believe, they still
stand, having reached a great height. A British officer
known as Mad Archy Campbell was married at Goose
Creek Church during the Revolution, under romantic
circumstances. Miss Paulina Phelps, a young lady of
the parish, was a great beauty and a great coquette,
who amused herself alike with American and British
officers. Campbell met and fell desperately in love with
her, and it is said that she encouraged him, though without
serious intent. One day he induced her to go horseback-riding
with him and on the ride made love to her
so vehemently that she was "intimidated into accepting
him." They rode to the rectory, and Campbell, meeting
the rector, demanded that he should marry them at once.
The dominie replied that he would do so "with the consent
of the young lady and her mother," but Campbell
proposed to await no such formalities. Drawing his
pistol he gave the minister the choice of performing the
ceremony then and there, or perishing. This argument
proved conclusive and the two were promptly wed.</p>

<p>When Goose Creek was within the British lines it is
said that the minister proceeded, upon one occasion, to
utter the prayer for the King of England, in the Litany.
At the end of the prayer there were no "Amens," the
congregation having been composed almost entirely, as
the story goes, of believers in American independence.
Into the awkward pause after the prayer one voice from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the congregation was at last injected. It was the voice
of old Ralph Izard, saying heartily, not "Amen," but
"Good Lord, deliver us!" There is a tablet in the
church to the memory of this worthy.</p>

<p>The story is told, also, of an old gentleman, a member
of the congregation in Revolutionary times, who informed
the minister that if he again read the prayer for
the King he would throw his prayer-book at his head.
The minister took this for a jest, but when he began to
read the prayer on the following Sunday, he found that
it was not, for sure enough the prayer-book came
hurtling through the air. Prayer-books were heavier
then than they are now, and it is said that as a result of
this episode, the minister refused to hold service thereafter.</p>

<p>The church is not now used regularly, an occasional
memorial service only being held there.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Charleston is a hard place to leave. Wherever one
may be going from there, the change is likely to be
for the worse. Nevertheless, it is impossible to stay
forever; so at last you muster up your resignation and
your resources, buy tickets, and reluctantly prepare to
leave. If you depart as we did, you go by rail, driving
to the station in the venerable bus of the Charleston
Transfer Company&mdash;a conveyance which, one judges,
may be coeval with the city's oldest mansions. Little as
we wished to leave Charleston we did not wish to defer
our departure through any such banality as the unneces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>sary
missing of a train. Therefore as we waited for
the bus, on the night of leaving, and as train time drew
nearer and nearer, with no sign of the lumbering old
vehicle, we became somewhat concerned.</p>

<p>When the bus did come at last there was little time
to spare; nevertheless the conductor, an easygoing man
of great volubility, consumed some precious minutes in
gossiping with the hotel porter, and then with arranging
and rearranging the baggage on the roof of the bus.
His manner was that of an amateur bus conductor, trying
a new experiment. After watching his performances
for a time, looking occasionally at my watch, by
way of giving him a hint, I broke out into expostulation
at the unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the man in a gentle, almost
grieved tone.</p>

<p>"There's very little time!" I returned. "We don't
wish to miss the train."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," said the bus conductor, making more
haste, as though the information I had given him put a
different face on matters generally.</p>

<p>Presently we started. After a time he collected our
fares. I have forgotten whether the amount was twenty-five
or fifty cents. At all events, as he took the money
from my hand he said to me reassuringly:</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, sir! If I don't get you to the train
I'll give you this money back. That's fair, ain't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

OUT OF THE PAST</h2>


<p>By no means all the leading citizens of Atlanta
were in a frame of mind to welcome General
Sherman when, ten or a dozen years after the
Civil War, he revisited the city. Captain Evan P.
Howell, a former Confederate officer, then publisher of
the Atlanta "Constitution," was, however, not one of
the Atlantans who ignored the general's visit. Taking
his young son, Clark, he called upon the general at the
old Kimball House (later destroyed by fire), and had
an interesting talk with him. Clark Howell, who has
since succeeded his father as publisher of the "Constitution,"
was born while the latter was fighting at Chickamauga,
and was consequently old enough, at the time
of the call on Sherman, to remember much of what was
said. He heard the general tell Captain Howell why
he had made such a point of taking Atlanta, and as Sherman's
military reasons for desiring possession of the
Georgia city explain, to a large extent, Atlanta's subsequent
development, I shall quote them as Clark Howell
gave them to me.</p>

<p>First however, it is perhaps worth while to remind
the reader of the bare circumstances preceding the fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
of Atlanta. After the defeat of the Confederate forces
at Chattanooga, General Joseph E. Johnston's army fell
back slowly on Atlanta, much as the French fell back on
Paris at the beginning of the European War, shortening
their own lines of communication while those of the advancing
Germans were being continually attenuated.
As the Germans kept after the French, Sherman kept
after Johnston; and as Joffre was beginning to be criticized
for failing to make a stand against the enemy, so
was Johnston criticized as he continued to retire without
giving battle. One of the chief differences between
Joffre's retirement and Johnston's lies, however, in the
length of time consumed; for whereas the French retreat
on Paris covered a few days only, the Confederate retreat
on Atlanta covered weeks and months, giving the
Confederate Government time to become impatient with
Johnston and finally to remove him from command before
the time arrived when, in his judgment, the stand
against Sherman should be made. Nor is it inconceivable
that, had the French retreat lasted as long as Johnston's,
Joffre would have been removed and would have
lost the opportunity to justify his Fabian policy, as he
did so gloriously at the Battle of the Marne.</p>

<p>Though Atlanta was, at the time of the war, a city
of less than 10,000 inhabitants, it was the chief base of
supply for men and munitions in the Far South.</p>

<p>"When my father asked him why all his effort and
power had been centered, after Chickamauga, on the
capture of Atlanta," said Clark Howell, "I remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
that General Sherman extended one hand with the fingers
spread apart, explaining the strategic situation by
imagining Atlanta as occupying a position where the
wrist joins the hand, while the thumb and fingers represented,
successively, New Orleans, Mobile, Savannah,
Charleston, and Norfolk. 'If I held Atlanta,' he said,
'I was only one day's journey from these chief cities of
the South.'"</p>

<p>In spite, therefore, of the assertion, which I have
heard made, that the prosperity of Atlanta is "founded
on insurance premiums, coca-cola, and hot air," it seems
to me that it is founded on something very much more
solid. Nor do I refer to the layer of granite which underlies
the city. The prosperity of Atlanta is based
upon the very feature which made its capture seem to
Sherman so desirable: its strategic position as a central
point in the Far South.</p>

<p>Neither in Atlanta nor in any other part of Georgia
is General Sherman remembered with a feeling that
can properly be described as affectionate, though it
may be added that Atlanta has good reason for remembering
him warmly. The burning of Atlanta by Sherman
did not, however, prove an unalloyed disaster, for
the war came to an end soon after, and the rebuilding
of the city supplied work for thousands of former Confederate
soldiers, and also drew to Atlanta many of the
strong men who played leading parts in the subsequent
commercial upbuilding of the place: such men as the late
General Alfred Austell, Captain James W. English, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the three Inman brothers, Samuel, John, and Hugh&mdash;to
mention but a few names. The First National Bank,
established by General Austell, is, I believe, Atlanta's
largest bank to-day, and was literally the first national
bank established in Georgia, if not in the whole South,
after the war.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson was admitted to the bar in Atlanta,
and, if I mistake not, practised law in an office not far
from that meeting place of highways called Five Points.
Here, at Five Points, two important trails crossed, long
before there was any Atlanta: the north-and-south trail
between Savannah and Ross's Landing, and the east-and-west
trail, which followed the old Indian trails between
Charleston and New Orleans. When people from
this part of the country wished to go to Ohio, Indiana,
or the Mississippi Valley, they would take the old north-and-south
trail to Ross's Landing, follow the Tennessee
River to where it empties into the Ohio, near Paducah,
Kentucky, and proceed thence to Mississippi.</p>

<p>In the thirties, Atlanta&mdash;or rather the site of Atlanta,
for the city was not founded until 1840&mdash;was on the border
of white civilization in northern Georgia, all the
country to the north of the Chattahoochee River, which
flows a few miles distant from the city, having belonged
to the Cherokee Indians, who had been moved there
from Florida. Even in those times the Cherokees were
civilized, as Indians go, for they lived in huts and practised
agriculture. Of course, however, their civilization
was not comparable with that of the white man. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
they had been as civilized as he, they might have driven
him out of Florida, instead of having been themselves
driven out, and they might have driven him out of
Georgia, too, instead of having been pushed on, as they
were, to the Indian Territory&mdash;eighteen thousand of
them, under military supervision, on boats from Ross's
Landing&mdash;leaving the beautiful white Cherokee rose,
which grows wild and in great profusion, in the spring,
as almost their sole memorial on Georgia soil.</p>

<p>As Georgia became settled the trails developed into
wagon and stage routes, and later they were followed,
approximately, by the railroads. After three railroads
had reached Atlanta, the State of Georgia engaged in
what may have been the first adventure, in this country,
along the lines of government-owned railroads: namely,
the building of the Western &amp; Atlantic, from Atlanta to
Chattanooga, to form a link between the lower South
and the rapidly developing West. This road was built
in the forties, and it was along its line that Johnston retreated
before Sherman, from Chattanooga to Atlanta.
Though it is now leased and operated by the Nashville,
Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company, it is still
owned by the State of Georgia. The lease, however, expires
soon, and (an interesting fact in view of the continued
agitation in other parts of the country for government
ownership of corporations) there is a strong sentiment
in Georgia in favor of selling the railroad; for it is
estimated that, at a fair price, it would yield a sum sufficient
not only to wipe out the entire bonded indebtedness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of the State ($7,000,000), but to leave ten or twelve millions
clear in the State treasury.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At Roswell, Georgia, a sleepy little hamlet in the
hills, not many miles from Atlanta, stands Bulloch Hall,
where Martha ("Mittie") Bulloch, later Mrs. Theodore
Roosevelt, mother of the President, was born. Roswell
was originally settled, long ago, by people from Savannah,
Darien, and other towns of the flat, hot country
near the coast, who drove there in their carriages and
remained during the summer. After a time, however,
three prosperous families&mdash;the Bullochs, Dunwoodys,
and Barrington Kings&mdash;made their permanent homes at
Roswell.</p>

<p>Bulloch Hall is one of those old white southern colonial
houses the whole front of which consists of a
great pillared portico, in the Greek style, giving a look
of dignity and hospitality. Almost all such houses are,
as they should be, surrounded by fine old trees; those at
Bulloch Hall are especially fine: tall cedars, ancient
white oaks, giant osage oranges, and a pair of holly
trees, one at either side of the walk near the front door.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., and Mittie Bulloch met here
when they were respectively seventeen and fifteen years
of age. A half sister of Miss Mittie had married a
relative of the Roosevelts and gone from Roswell to live
in Philadelphia, and it was while visiting at her home
that young Roosevelt, hearing a great deal of the South,
conceived a desire to go there. This resulted in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
first visit to Bulloch Hall, and his meeting with Mittie
Bulloch. On his return to the North he was sent
abroad, but two or three years later when he went again
to visit his relatives in Philadelphia, Miss Mittie was
also a guest at their house, and this time the two became
engaged.</p>

<p>Save that the Bulloch furniture is no longer there, the
interior of the old Georgia residence stands practically
as it was when Theodore Roosevelt and Mittie Bulloch
were married in the dining room. Through the center,
from front to back, runs a wide hall, on either side of
which is a pair of spacious square rooms, each with a
fireplace, each with large windows looking out over the
beautiful hilly country which spreads all about. It
is a lovely house in a lovely setting, and, though the Bullochs
reside there no longer, Miss Mittie Bulloch is not
forgotten in Roswell, for one of her bridesmaids, Miss
Evelyn King, now Mrs. Baker, still resides in Barrington
Hall, not far distant from the old Bulloch homestead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

ALIVE ATLANTA</h2>


<p>An army officer, a man of broad sympathies,
familiar with the whole United States, warned
me before I went south that I must not judge
the South by northern standards.</p>

<p>"On the side of picturesqueness and charm," he said,
"the South can more than hold its own against the rest
of the country; likewise on the side of office-holding and
flowery oratory; but you must not expect southern cities
to have the energy you are accustomed to in the North."</p>

<p>As to the picturesqueness, charm, officeholding, and
oratory, I found his judgments substantially correct,
but though I did perceive a certain lack of energy in
some small cities, I should not call that trait a leading
one in the larger southern cities to-day. On the contrary,
I was impressed, in almost every large center that
I visited, with the fact that, in the South more, perhaps,
than in any other part of the country, a great awakening
is in progress. The dormant period of the South is
past, and all manner of developments are everywhere in
progress. Nor do I know of any city which better exemplifies
southern growth and progress than Atlanta.</p>

<p>My Baedeker, dated 1909, opens its description of At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>lanta
with the statement that the German consul there
is Dr. E. Zoepffel. I doubt it&mdash;but let us pass over that.
It describes Atlanta as "a prosperous commercial and
industrial city and an important railroad center, well
situated, 1030-1175 feet above the sea, enjoying a
healthy and bracing climate." That is true. Atlanta
is, if I mistake not, the highest important city east of
Denver, and I believe her climate is in part responsible
for her energy, as it is also for the fact that her vegetation
is more like that of a northern than a southern
city, elms and maples rather than magnolias, being the
trees of the Atlanta streets.</p>

<p>Baedeker gave Atlanta about 90,000 inhabitants in
1909, but the census of 1910 jumped her up to more
than 150,000, while the estimate of 1917 in the "World
Almanac" credits her with about 180,000. Moreover,
in the almanac's list of the largest cities of the earth,
Atlanta comes twentieth from the top. It is my duty,
perhaps, to add that the list is arranged alphabetically&mdash;which
reminds me that some cynic has suggested that
there may have been an alphabetical arrangement of
names, also, in the celebrated list in which Abou Ben
Adhem's "name led all the rest." Nevertheless, it may
be stated that, according to the almanac's population
figures, Atlanta is larger than the much more ancient
city of Athens (I refer to Athens, Greece; not Athens,
Georgia), as well as such considerable cities as Bari,
Bochum, Graz, Kokand, and Omsk. Atlanta is, in
short, a city of about the size of Goteborg, and if she has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
not yet achieved the dimensions of Baku, Belem, Changsha,
Tashkent, or West Ham, she is growing rapidly,
and may some day surpass them all; yes, and even that
thriving metropolis, Yekaterinoslav.</p>

<p>As to the "healthy and bracing climate," I know that
Atlanta is cool and lovely in the spring, and I am told
that her prosperous families do not make it a practice
to absent themselves from home during the summer,
according to the custom of the corresponding class in
many other cities, northern as well as southern.</p>

<p>Atlanta is one of the few large inland cities located
neither upon a river nor a lake. When the city was
founded, the customs of life in Georgia were such that
no one ever dreamed that the State might some day go
dry. Having plenty of other things to drink, the early
settlers gave no thought to water. But, as time went on,
and prohibition became a more and more important
issue, the citizens of Atlanta began to perceive that, in
emergency, the Chattahoochee River might, after all,
have its uses. Water was, consequently, piped from the
river to the city, and is now generally&mdash;albeit in some
quarters mournfully&mdash;used. Though I am informed by
an expert in Indian languages that the Cherokee word
"chattahoochee" is short for "muddy," the water is filtered
before it reaches the city pipes, and is thoroughly
palatable, whether taken plain or mixed.</p>

<p>Well-off though Atlanta is, she would esteem herself
better off, in a material sense at least, had she a navigable
stream; for her chief industrial drawback consists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
in railroad freight rates unmodified by water competition.
She has, to be sure, a number of factories, including
a Ford automobile plant, but she has not so many
factories as her strategic position, stated by General
Sherman, would seem to justify, or as her own industrial
ambitions cause her to desire. For does not every progressive
American city yearn to bristle with factory
chimneys, even as a summer resort folder bristles with
exclamation points? And is not soot a measure of
success?</p>

<p>Atlanta's line of business is largely office business;
many great corporations have their headquarters or
their general southern branches in the city; one of the
twelve Federal Reserve Banks is there, and there are
many strong banks. Indeed, I suppose Atlanta has more
bankers, in proportion to her population, than any other
city in the United States. Some of these bankers are
active citizens and permanent residents of the city;
others have given up banking for the time being and
are in temporary residence at the Federal Penitentiary.</p>

<p>The character of commerce carried on, naturally
brings to Atlanta large numbers of prosperous and able
men&mdash;corporation officials, branch managers, manufacturers'
agents, and the like&mdash;who, with their families,
give Atlanta a somewhat individual social flavor. This
class of population also accounts for the fact that the
enterprisingness so characteristic of Atlanta is not the
mere rough, ebullient spirit of "go to it!" to be found
in so many hustling cities of the Middle West and West,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
but is, oftentimes, an informed and cultivated kind
of enterprisingness, which causes Atlanta not only to
"do things," but to do things showing vision, and, furthermore,
to do them with an "air."</p>

<img src="images/p376.jpg" width="440" height="600" alt="The office buildings are city office buildings, and are sufficiently numerous to
look very much at home" title="" />
<span class="caption">The office buildings are city office buildings, and are sufficiently numerous to
look very much at home</span>
</div>

<p>This is illustrated in various ways. It is shown, for
example, in Atlanta's principal hotels, which are not
small-town hotels, or good-enough hotels, but would do
credit to any city, however great. The office buildings
are city office buildings, and in the downtown section
they are sufficiently numerous to look very much at
home, instead of appearing a little bit exotic, self-conscious,
and lonesome, as new skyscrapers do in so many
cities of Atlanta's size. Even the smoke with which
the skyscrapers are streaked is city smoke. Chicago
herself could hardly produce smoke of more metropolitan
texture&mdash;certainly not on the Lake Front, where the
Illinois Central trains send up their black clouds; for Atlanta's
downtown smoke, like Chicago's, comes in large
part from railroads piercing the heart of the city.
Where downtown business streets cross the railroad
tracks, the latter are depressed, the highways passing
above on steel bridges resembling the bridges over the
Chicago River. The railroad's right of way is, furthermore,
just about as wide as the Chicago River, and rows
of smoke-stained brick buildings turn their backs upon
it, precisely as similar buildings turn theirs upon Chicago's
busy, narrow stream. I wonder if all travelers,
familiar with Chicago, are so persistently reminded of
that portion of the city which is near the river, as I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
by that portion of Atlanta abutting on the tracks by
which the Seaboard Air Line enters the city.</p>

<span class="caption">A reminder of the Chicago River&mdash;Atlanta</span>
</div>

<p>Generally speaking, railroads in the South have not
been so prosperous as leading roads in the North, and
with the exception of the most important through trains,
their passenger equipment is, therefore, not so good.
The Seaboard Air Line, however, runs an all-steel train
between Atlanta and Birmingham which, in point of
equipment, may be compared with the best limited trains
anywhere. The last car in this train, instead of being
part sleeping car and part observation car, is a combination
dining and observation car&mdash;a very pleasant
arrangement, for men are allowed to smoke in the observation
end after dinner. This is, to my mind, an improvement
over the practice of most railroads, which
obliges men who wish to smoke to leave the ladies with
whom they may be traveling. All Seaboard dining cars
offer, aside from regular &agrave; la carte service, a sixty-cent
dinner known as the "Blue Plate Special." This
dinner has many advantages over the usual dining-car
repast. In the first place, though it does not
comprise bread and butter, coffee or tea, or dessert, it
provides an ample supply of meat and vegetables at a
moderate price. In the second place, though served at
a fixed price, it bears no resemblance to the old-style
dining car table d'h&ocirc;te, but, upon the contrary, looks
and tastes like food. The food, furthermore, instead
of representing a great variety of viands served in microscopic
helpings on innumerable platters and "side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
dishes," comes on one great plate, with recesses for vegetables.
The "Blue Plate Special" furnishes, in short,
the chief items in a "good home meal."</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, as convenient a place as any in which
to speak of certain points concerning various railroads in
the South. The Central of Georgia Railway, running
between Atlanta and Savannah, instead of operating
Pullmans, has its own sleeping cars. This is the only
railroad I know of in the country on which the tenant
of a lower berth, below an unoccupied upper, may have
the upper closed without paying for it. One likes the
Central of Georgia for this humane dispensation. The
locomotives of the Western &amp; Atlantic carry as a distinguishing
mark a red band at the top of the smokestack.
The Southern Railway assigns engineers to individual
engines, instead of "pooling power," as is the
practice, I believe, on many railroads. Because of this,
engineers on the Southern regard the locomotives to
which they are regularly assigned, as their personal
property, and exercise their individual taste in embellishing
them. Brass bands, brass flagstaffs, brass eagles
over the headlight, and similar adornments are therefore
often seen on the engines of this road, giving the most
elaborate of them a carnival appearance, by contrast
with the somber black to which most of us are accustomed,
and hinting that not all the individuality has been
unionized out of locomotive engineers&mdash;an impression
heightened by the Southern Railway's further pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
custom of painting the names of its older and more
expert engineers upon the cabs of their locomotives.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some cities are like lumbering old farm horses, plugging
along a dusty country road. When another horse
overtakes them, if they be not altogether wanting in
spirit, they may be encouraged to jog a little faster for
a moment, stimulated by example. If, besides being
stupid, they are mean, then they want to kick or bite at
the speedier animal going by. Some cities are like that,
too. If an energetic city overtakes them, they are not
spurred on to emulation, but lay back their ears, so to
speak. Again, there are tough, sturdy little cities like
buckskin ponies. There are skittish cities which seem to
have been badly broken. There are old cities with a
worn-out kind of elegance, like that of superannuated
horses of good breed, hitched to an old-fashioned
barouche. There are bad, bucking cities, like Butte,
Montana. And here and there are cities, like Atlanta,
reminding one of thoroughbred hunters. There is a
brave, sporting something in the spirit of Atlanta which
makes it rush courageously at big jumps, and clear them,
and land clean on the other side, and be off again.
Like a thoroughbred, she loves the chase. She goes in
to win. She doesn't stop to worry about whether
she can win or not. She knows she will. And as
the thoroughbred, loving large and astonishing achievement,
lacks the humbler virtues of the reliable family car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>riage
horse, Atlanta, it cannot be denied, has "<i>les d&eacute;fauts
de ses qualit&eacute;s</i>." For whereas, on the side of dashing
performance, Atlanta held a stock fair which, in one
year, surpassed any other held in the South, and secured
the grand circuit of races, on the other side she is careless
about hospitals and charities; and whereas, on the
one side, she has raised millions for the building of two
new universities (which, by the way, would be much
better as one great university, but cannot be, because of
sectarian domination), on the other, she is deficient as to
schools; and again, whereas she is the only secondary
city to have an annual season of Metropolitan grand
opera (and to make it pay!) she is behind many other
cities, including her neighbors, New Orleans and Savannah,
in caring for the public health.</p>

<p>I am by no means sure that the regular spring visit of
the Metropolitan Grand Opera Company may be taken
as a sign that Atlanta is peculiarly a music-loving community.
Indeed, I was told by one Atlanta lady, herself
a musician, that the city did not contain more than a
thousand persons of real musical appreciation, that a
number of these could not afford to attend the operatic
performances, and that opera week was, consequently,
in reality more an occasion of great social festivity than
of devout homage to art.</p>

<p>"Our opera week," she told me, "bears the same relation
to the life of Atlanta as Mardi Gras does to that of
New Orleans. It is an advertisement for the city, and
an excuse for every one to have a good time. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
night after the performance there are suppers and
dances, which the opera stars attend. They always
seem to enjoy coming here. They act as though they
were off on a picnic, skylarking about the hotel, snap-shotting
one another, and playing all manner of pranks.
And, of course, while they are here they own the town.
Caruso draws his little caricatures for the Atlanta girls,
and Atlanta men have been dazzled, in successive seasons,
by such gorgeous beings as Geraldine Farrar,
Alma Gluck, and Maria Barrientos&mdash;not only across the
footlights of the auditorium, mind you, but at close
range; as, for instance, at dances at the Driving Club,
with Chinese lanterns strung on the terrace, a full moon
above, and&mdash;one year&mdash;with the whole Metropolitan
Orchestra playing dance music all night long!"</p>

<p>Another lady, endeavoring to picture to me the strain
involved in the week's gaieties, informed me that when
it was all over she went for a rest to New York, where
she attended "a house party at the Waldorf"!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of all Atlanta's undertakings, planned or accomplished,
that which most interested my companion and
me was the one for turning a mountain into a sculptured
monument to the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Sixteen miles to the east of the city the layer of granite
which underlies the region stuck its back up, so to speak,
forming a great smooth granite hump, known as Stone
Mountain. This mountain is one of America's natural
wonders. In form it may be compared with a round-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>backed
fish, such as a whale or porpoise, lying on its
belly, partly imbedded in a beach, and some conception
of its dimensions may be gathered from the fact that
from nose to tail it measures about two miles, while the
center of its back is as high as the Woolworth Building
in New York. Moreover, there is not a fissure in it;
monoliths a thousand feet long have been quarried from
it; it is as solid as the Solid South.</p>

<p>The perpendicular streaks of light and dark gray and
gray-green, made by the elements upon the face of the
rock, coupled with the waterfall-like curve of that face,
make one think of a sort of sublimated petrified Niagara&mdash;a
fancy enhanced, on windy days, by the roar of the
gale-lashed forest at the mountain's foot.</p>

<p>The idea of turning the mountain into a Confederate
memorial originated with Mr. William H. Terrell of
Atlanta. It was taken up with inspired energy by Mrs.
C. Helen Plane, an Atlanta lady, now eighty-seven years
of age, who is honorary president of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy and president of the Stone
Mountain Memorial Association. Mrs. Plane presented
the memorial plan to Mr. Samuel H. Venable of Venable
Brothers, owners of the mountain, and Mr. Venable
promptly turned over the whole face of the mountain to
the Memorial Association. The exact form the memorial
was to take had not at that time been developed.
Gutzon Borglum was, however, called in, and worked
out a stupendous idea, which he has since been commissioned
to execute. On the side of the mountain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
about four hundred feet above the ground, a roadway is
to be gouged out of the granite. On this roadway will
be carved, in gigantic outlines, a Confederate army,
headed by Lee and Jackson on horseback. Other generals
will follow, and will, in turn, be followed by infantry,
cavalry and artillery. The leading groups will
be in full relief and the equestrian figures will be fifty or
more feet tall. This means that the faces of the chief
figures will measure almost the height of a man. The
figures to the rear of the long column will, according to
present plans, be in bas-relief, and the whole procession
will cover a strip perhaps a mile long, all of it carved out
of the solid mountainside.</p>

<p>A considerable tract of forest land at the foot of the
great rock has already been dedicated as a park. Here,
concealed by the trees, at a point below the main group
of figures, a temple, with thirteen columns representing
the thirteen Confederate States, is to be hewn out of the
mountain, to be used as a place for the safe-keeping of
Confederate relics and archives.</p>

<p>Two million dollars is the sum spoken of to cover the
total cost, and one of the finest things about the plans
for raising this money is that contributions from the
entire country are being accepted, so that not only the
South, but the whole nation, may have a share in the
creation of a memorial to that dead government which
the South so poetically adores, yet which it would not
willingly resurrect, and in the realization of a work resembling
nothing so much as Kipling's conception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
artist in heaven, who paints on "a ten-league canvas,
with brushes of comet's hair."</p>

<p>Until the Stone Mountain Memorial is completed,
Atlanta's most celebrated monument will continue to be
that of Jack Smith. The Jack Smith monument stands
in Oakland Cemetery, not over the grave of Jack Smith,
but over the grave that local character intends some day
to occupy. Mr. Smith is reputed to be rich. He built
the downtown office building known as "The House that
Jack Built." As befits the owner of an office building,
he wears a silk hat, but a certain democratic simplicity
may be observed in the rest of his attire, especially about
the region of the neck, for though he apparently believes
in the convention concerning the wearing of collars, he
has a prejudice against the concealing of a portion of
the collar by that useless and snobbish adornment, the
necktie. Each spring, I am informed, it is his custom
to visit his cemetery lot and inspect the statue of himself
which a commendable foresight has caused him to erect
over his proposed final resting place. It is said that
upon the occasion of last season's vernal visit he was
annoyed at finding his effigy cravated by a vine which
had grown up and encircled the neck. This he caused
to be removed; and it is to be hoped that when, at
last, his monument achieves its ultimate purpose, those
who care for the cemetery will see to it that leafy tendrils
be not permitted to mount to the marble collar of the

collar button.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

GEORGIA JOURNALISM</h2>


<p>In journalism Atlanta is far in advance of many cities
of her size, North or South. The Atlanta "Constitution,"
founded nearly half a century ago, is one
of the country's most distinguished newspapers. The
"Constitution" came into its greatest fame in the early
eighties, when Captain Evan P. Howell&mdash;the same Captain
Howell who commanded a battery at the battle of
Peachtree Creek, in the defense of Atlanta, and who
later called, with his son, on General Sherman, as
already recorded&mdash;became its editor, and Henry W.
Grady its managing editor. Like William Allen White
and Walt Mason of the Emporia (Kansas) "Gazette,"
who work side by side, admire each other, but disagree
on every subject save that of the infallibility of the
ground hog as a weather prophet, Howell and Grady
worked side by side and were devoted friends, while disagreeing
personally, and in print, on prohibition and
many other subjects. Grady would speak at prohibition
rallies and, sometimes on the same night, Howell would
speak at anti-prohibition rallies. In their speeches they
would attack each other. The accounts of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
speeches, as well as conflicting articles written by the
two, would always appear in the "Constitution."</p>

<p>Of the pair of public monuments to individuals which
I remember having seen in Atlanta, one was the pleasing
memorial, in Piedmont Park, to Sidney Lanier (who was
peculiarly a Georgia poet, having been born in Macon, in
that State, and having written some of his most beautiful
lines under the spell of Georgia scenes), and the other the
statue of Henry W. Grady, which stands downtown in
Marietta Street.</p>

<p>The Grady monument&mdash;one regrets to say it&mdash;is less
fortunate as a work of art than as a deserved symbol of
remembrance. Grady not only ought to have a monument,
but as one whose writings prove him to have been
a man of taste, he ought to have a better one than this
poor mid-Victorian thing, placed in the middle of a wide,
busy street, with Fords parked all day long about its base.</p>

<p>Says the inscription:</p>

<p class='center'>
HE NEVER SOUGHT A PUBLIC OFFICE.<br />
 WHEN HE DIED HE WAS LITERALLY<br />
  LOVING A NATION INTO PEACE.
</p>

<p>On another side of the base is chiseled a characteristic
extract from one of Grady's speeches. This speech was
made in 1899, in Boston, and one hopes that it may have
been heard by the late Charles Francis Adams, who
labored in Massachusetts for the cause of intersectional
harmony, just as Grady worked for it in Georgia.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This hour [said Grady] little needs the loyalty that is loyal
to one section and yet holds the other in enduring suspicion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
estrangement. Give us the broad and perfect loyalty that loves
and trusts Georgia alike with Massachusetts&mdash;that knows no
South, no North, no East, no West; but endears with equal and
patriotic love every foot of our soil, every State in our Union.</p></div>

<p>Grady could not only write and say stirring things; he
could be witty. He once spoke at a dinner of the New
England Society, in New York, at which General Sherman
was also present.</p>

<p>"Down in Georgia," he said, "we think of General
Sherman as a great general; but it seems to us he was a
little careless with fire."</p>

<p>Nor was Grady less brilliant as managing editor than
upon the platform. He had the kind of enterprise which
made James Gordon Bennett such a dashing figure in
newspaper life, and the New York "Herald" such a complete
<i>news</i>paper&mdash;the kind of enterprise that charters
special trains, and at all hazards gets the story it
is after. Back in the early eighties Grady was running
the Atlanta "Constitution" in just that way. If a
big story "broke" in any of the territory around Atlanta,
Grady would not wait upon train schedules, but would
hire an engine and send his men to the scene. Once, following
a sensational murder, he learned that the Birmingham
"Age-Herald" had a big story dealing with
developments in the case. He wired the "Age-Herald"
offering a large price for the story. When his offer
was refused Grady knew that if he could not devise a
way to get the story, Atlanta would be flooded next day
with "Age-Heralds" containing the "beat" on the "Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>stitution."
He at once chartered a locomotive and
rushed two reporters and four telegraph operators down
the line toward Birmingham. At Aniston, Alabama,
the locomotive met the train which was bringing "Age-Heralds"
to Atlanta. A copy of the paper was secured.
The "Constitution" men then broke into a telegraph
office and wired the whole story in to their paper, with
the result that the "Constitution" was out with it before
the Birmingham papers reached Atlanta.</p>

<p>Atlanta was at that time a town of only about 40,000
inhabitants, but the "Constitution," in the days of
Howell and Grady, had a circulation four times greater
than the total population of the city&mdash;a situation almost
unheard of in journalism. Something of the breadth
of its influence may be gathered from the fact that in
several counties in Texas, where the law provided that
whatever newspaper had the largest circulation in the
county should be the county organ, the county organ
was the Atlanta "Constitution."</p>

<p>An Atlanta lady tells of having called upon Grady
to complain about an article which she did not think the
"Constitution" should have printed.</p>

<p>"Why did you put that objectionable article in your
paper?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Did you read it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Then," said Grady, "that's why I put it there."</p>

<p>Grady and Howell always ran a lively sporting de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>partment.
Away back in the days of bare-knuckle prize
fights&mdash;such as those between Sullivan and Ryan, and
Sullivan and Kilrain&mdash;a "Constitution" reporter was always
at the ringside, no matter where the fight might
take place. For a newspaper in a town of forty or fifty
thousand inhabitants, a large percentage of them colored
illiterates, this was real enterprise.</p>

<p>A favorite claim of Grady's was that his reporters
were the greatest "leg artists" in the world. He used
to organize walking matches for reporters, offering
large prizes and charging admission. This developed,
in the middle eighties, a general craze for such matches,
and resulted in the holding of many inter-city contests,
in which teams, four men to a side, took part. One of
the "Constitution's" champion "leg artists" was Sam W.
Small, now an evangelist and member of the "flying
squadron" of the Anti-Saloon League of America.</p>

<p>The most widely celebrated individual ever connected
with the "Constitution" was Joel Chandler Harris, many
of whose "Uncle Remus" stories&mdash;those negro folk
tales still supreme in their field&mdash;appeared originally in
that paper. In view of Mr. Harris's achievement it is
pleasant to recall that there was paid to him during his
life one of the finest tributes that an author can receive.
As with "Mr. Dooley" of our day, he came, himself, to
be affectionately referred to by the name of the chief
character in his works. "Uncle Remus" he was, and
"Uncle Remus" he will always be. Mr. Harris's eldest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
son, Julian, widely known as a journalist, is said to have
been the little boy to whom "Uncle Remus" told his
tales.</p>

<p>Though there is, as yet, no public monument in Atlanta
to Joel Chandler Harris, the "Wren's Nest," his
former home, at 214 Gordon Street, is fittingly preserved
as a memorial. Visitors may see the old letter
box fastened to a tree by the gate&mdash;that box in
which a wren built her nest, giving the house its name.
It is a simple old house with the air of a home about
it, and the intimate possessions of the author lie about
as he left them. His bed is made up, his umbrella hangs
upon the mantelshelf, his old felt hat rests upon the
rack, the photograph of his friend James Whitcomb
Riley looks down from the bedroom wall, and on the
table, by the window, stands his typewriter&mdash;the confidant
first to know his new productions.</p>

<p>The presence of these personal belongings keeps alive
the illusion that "Uncle Remus" has merely stepped
out for a little while&mdash;is hiding in the garden, waiting
for us to go away. It would be like him, for he
was among the most modest and retiring of men, as
there are many amusing anecdotes to indicate. Once
when some one had persuaded him to attend a large
dinner in New York, they say, he got as far as New
York, but as the dinner hour approached could not bear
to face the adulation awaiting him, and incontinently
fled back to Atlanta.</p>

<p>Frank L. Stanton, poet laureate of Georgia, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the "Constitution," joined the "Constitution" staff
through the efforts of Mr. Harris, one of whose closest
intimates he was. Speaking of Mr. Harris's gift for
negro dialect, Mr. Stanton told me that there was one
negro exclamation which "Uncle Remus" always wished
to reproduce, but which he never quite felt could be
expressed, in writing, to those unfamiliar with the
negro at first hand: that is the exclamation of amazement,
which has the sound, "mmm&mdash;<i>mh!</i>"&mdash;the first syllable
being long and the last sharp and exclamatory.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton has for years conducted a column of
verse and humorous paragraphic comment, under the
heading "Just from Georgia," on the editorial page of
the "Constitution." Some idea of the high estimation
in which he is held in his State is to be gathered from
the fact that "Frank L. Stanton Day" is annually celebrated
in the Georgia schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton began his newspaper career as a country
editor in the town of Smithville, Georgia. Mr. Harris,
then a member of the "Constitution's" editorial staff,
began reprinting in that journal verses and paragraphs
written by Stanton, with the result that the Smithville
paper became known all over the country. Later Stanton
moved to Rome, Georgia, becoming an editorial
writer on a paper there&mdash;the "Tribune," edited at that
time by John Temple Graves, if I am not mistaken.
Still later he removed to Atlanta, joined the staff of the
"Constitution," and started the department which has
now continued for more than twenty-five years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>Joel Chandler Harris used to tell a story about Stanton's
first days in the "Constitution" office. According
to this story, the paper on which Stanton had worked
in Rome had not been prosperous, and salaries were
uncertain. When the business manager went out
to try to raise money in the town, he never returned
without first reading the signals placed by his assistant
in the office window. If a red flag was shown,
it signified that a collector was waiting in the office. In
that event the business manager would not come in, but
would circle about until the collector became tired of
waiting and departed&mdash;a circumstance indicated by the
withdrawal of the red flag and the substitution of a
white one. According to the story, as it was told to
me, reporters on the paper were seldom paid; if one of
them made bold to ask for his salary, he was likely to
be discharged. It was from this uncertain existence
that Stanton was lured to the "Constitution" by an offer
of $22.50 per week. When he had been on the "Constitution"
for three weeks Mr. Harris discovered that he
had drawn no salary. This surprised him&mdash;as indeed
it would any man who had had newspaper experience.</p>

<p>"Stanton," he said, "you are the only newspaper man
I have ever seen who is so rich he doesn't need to draw
his pay."</p>

<p>But, as it turned out, Stanton was not so prosperous
as Harris perhaps supposed. He was down to his last
dime, and had been wondering how he could manage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
get along; for his training on the Rome paper had taught
him never to ask for money lest he lose his job.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to Harris, "I could use <i>some</i> of my
salary&mdash;if you're sure it won't be any inconvenience?"</p>

<p>Those familiar with the works of Mr. Stanton, Mr.
Harris, and James Whitcomb Riley, Indiana's great
poet, will perceive that certain similar tastes and feelings
inform their writings, and will not be surprised
to learn, if not already aware of it, that the three were
friends. Mr. Stanton's only absence from Atlanta since
he joined the "Constitution," was on the occasion of a
visit he paid Mr. Riley at the latter's home in Indianapolis.
The best of Stanton's work must have appealed
to Riley, for it contains not a little of the kindly, homely,
humorous truthfulness, and warmth of sentiment, of
which Riley was himself such a master. Among the
most widely familiar verses of the Georgia poet are
those of his "Mighty Like a Rose," set to music by Ethelbert
Nevin, and "Just a-Wearying for You," with music
by Carrie Jacobs Bond. "Money" is a verse in
hilarious key, which many will remember for the comical
vigor of the last three lines in its first stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When a fellow has spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His last red cent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world looks blue, you bet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But give him a dollar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you'll hear him holler:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There's life in the old land yet!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Richly humorous though Stanton is, he can also
reach the heart. The former Governor of a Western
State picked up Stanton's book, "Songs of the Soil,"
and after reading "Hanging Bill Jones," and "A Tragedy,"
therein, commuted the sentence of a man who was
to have been executed next day. One hopes the man
deserved to escape. In another case an individual who
was about to commit suicide chanced to see in an old
newspaper Stanton's encouraging verses called "Keep
a-Goin'," and was stimulated by them to have a fresh
try at life on earth instead of elsewhere.</p>

<p>Joel Chandler Harris wrote the introduction to
"Songs of the Soil." Other collections of Stanton's
works are "Songs of Dixie Land," and "Comes One
With a Song." The danger in starting to quote from
these books&mdash;which, by the way, are chiefly made up of
measures that appeared originally in the "Constitution"&mdash;is
that one does not like to stop. I have, however,
limited myself to but one more theft, and instead
of making my own choice, have left the selection to a
friend of Mr. Stanton's, who has suggested the lines
entitled "A Poor Unfortunate":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His hoss went dead, an' his mule went lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lost six cows in a poker game;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I reckon it's time to git up an' git,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Lord, I hain't had the measles yit!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among those who have been on the staff of the "Constitution"
and have become widely known, may be mentioned
the gifted Corra Harris, many of whose stories
have Georgia backgrounds, and who still keeps as a
country home in the State where she was born, a log
cabin, known as "In the Valley," at Pine Log, Georgia;
also the perhaps equally (though differently) talented
Robert Adamson, whose administration as fire
commissioner of the City of New York was so able as
to result in a reduction of insurance rates.</p>

<p>Atlanta reporters, it would seem, run to the New
York Fire Department, for Joseph Johnson, who preceded
Mr. Adamson as commissioner, was once a reporter
on the Atlanta "Journal." The latter paper used
to belong to Hoke Smith. It was at one time edited by
John Temple Graves, who later edited the Atlanta
"Georgian," and is now a member of the forces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
William Randolph Hearst, in New York. The late
Jacques Futrelle, the author, who went down with the
<i>Titanic</i>, was a Georgian, and worked for years on the
"Journal." Don Marquis, one of the most brilliant
American newspaper "columnists," now in charge of
the department known as "The Sun Dial" on the New
York "Evening Sun," was also at one time on the "Journal,"
as was likewise Grantland Rice, America's most
widely read sporting writer. Lollie Belle Wiley, whose
poetry has a distinct southern quality, is, I believe, a
member of the "Journal's" staff. As the eminent Ty
Cobb once wrote a book, it seems fair to mention him
also among Georgian authors, though so far as I know
he never worked on an Atlanta paper. And if Atlanta's
three celebrated golfers have not written for the papers,
they have at least supplied the sporting page with much
material. Miss Alexa Sterling of Atlanta, a young
lady under twenty, is one of the best women golfers in
the United States; Perry Adair also figures in national
golf, and Robert T. ("Bobby") Jones, Jr., who was
southern champion at the age of fourteen, is, perhaps,
an unprecedented marvel at the game&mdash;so at least my
golfing friends inform me.</p>

<p>The continued militancy of the "Constitution," under
the editorship of Clark Howell, who sits in his father's
old chair, with a bust of Grady at his elbow, is evidenced
not only by its frequent editorials against lynching, but
by its fearless campaign against another Georgia
specialty&mdash;the "paper colonel." The ranks of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
"paper colonels" in the South are chiefly made up of
lawyers who "have been colonelized by custom for no
other reason than that they have led their clients to victory
in legal battles." Some of the real colonels have
been objecting to the paper kind, and the "Constitution"
has bravely backed up the objection.</p>

<p>The liveliness of journalism in Georgia does not begin
and end in Atlanta. The Savannah "Morning
News" has an able editorial page, and there are many
others in the State. Some of the small-town papers are,
moreover, well worth reading for that kind of breeziness
which we usually associate with the West rather than
the South. Consider, for example, the following, in
which the Dahlonega (Georgia) "Nugget," published up
in the mountains, in the section where gold is mined,
discusses the failings of one Billie Adams, the editor's
own son-in-law:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On Saturday last, Billie Adams and his wife waylaid the public
road over on Crown Mountain, where this sorry piece of humanity
stood and cursed while his wife knocked down and beat her
sister, Emma. He is a son-in-law of ours, but if the Lord had
anything to do with him, He must have made a mistake and
thought He was breathing the breath of life into a dog.</p>

<p>He is too lazy to work and lays around and waits for his wife
to get what she can procure on credit, until she can get nothing
more for him and the children to eat. Recently he claimed to be
gone to Tennessee in search of work. Upon hearing that his
family had nothing to eat, we had Carl Brooksher send over nearly
four dollars' worth of provisions. In he came and sat there and
feasted until every bite was gone. But this ends it with us.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who have sorry kinfolks, but in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
instance if there were prizes offered, we would certainly win the
first.</p>

<p>Last year, thinking he would scare his mother-in-law and sister-in-law
off from where they live, so he could get the place, he shot
two holes through their window, turned their mule out of the
stable, and tried to run it into the bean patch, besides hanging
up a bunch of switches at the drawbars. Then their fence was
set afire twice. This is said to be the work of his wife. Then,
after carrying home meat, flour, lard, and vegetables to eat for
her mother and sister, he whipped the latter because she refused
to give him two of the wagon wheels.</p>

<p>The city made a case against both for the whipping, and the
wife, although coming to town alone frequently during the day,
brought her baby and everything to the council room, plead
guilty and was fined one and costs. Billie didn't appear, but if
he stays in this country Marshal Wimpy will have him, when all
these things will come to light, both in the council chamber and
grand jury room.</p></div>

<p>The scandal of newspaperdom in Georgia is, of
course, Tom Watson, who publishes the "Jeffersonian"&mdash;a
misnamed paper if there ever was one&mdash;in the town
of Thomson. Many years ago, when Edward P.
Thomas, now assistant to the president of the United
States Steel Corporation, was a little boy in Atlanta,
complaining about having his ears washed; when Theodore
D. Rousseau, secretary to Mayor Mitchel of New
York, was having his early education drilled into him
at the Ivy Street school; when Ralph Peters, now president
of the Long Island Railroad, had left Atlanta and
become a division superintendent on the Panhandle
Road; when the parents of Ivy Ledbetter Lee were wondering
to what college they would send him when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
grew to be a big boy; when Robert Adamson was a
page in the Georgia Legislature&mdash;as long ago as that,
Tom Watson was waving his red head and prominent
Adam's apple as a member of the State House of Representatives.
In the mad and merry days of Bryanism
he became a Populist Member of Congress. He
was nominated for vice-president, to run on the Populist
ticket with Bryan. Later he ran for president on
the ticket of some unheard-of party, organized in protest
against the "conservatism" of the Populists. Watson's
paper reminds one of Brann and his "Iconoclast."
Reading it, I have never been able to discover what
Watson was <i>for</i>. All I could find out was what he was
violently against&mdash;and that is almost everything. He
is the wild ass of Georgia journalism; the thistles of
chaos are sweet in him, and order in any department of
life is a chestnut burr beneath his tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<br />
SOME ATLANTA INSTITUTIONS</h2>


<p>There has been great rejoicing in Atlanta over
the raising of funds for the establishment there
of two new universities, Emory and Oglethorpe.
Emory was founded in 1914, as the result of a feud
which developed in Vanderbilt University, located at
Nashville, Tennessee, over the question as to whether
the institution should be controlled by the Board of
Bishops of the southern Methodist Episcopal Church, or
by the University trustees, who were not so much interested
in the development of the sectarian side of the university.
The fight was taken to the courts where the
trustees won. As a result, Methodist influence and support
were withdrawn from Vanderbilt, which thenceforward
became a non-sectarian college, and Emory was
started&mdash;Atlanta having been selected as its home because
nearly a million and a half dollars was raised in
Atlanta to bring it there.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe is to be a Presbyterian institution, and
starts off with a million dollars.</p>

<p>This will give Atlanta three rather important colleges,
since she already has the technical branch of the
University of Georgia, the main establishment of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
located at Athens, Georgia, is one of the oldest state
universities in the country, having been founded in 1801.
(The University of Tennessee is the oldest state university
in the South. It was founded in 1794. The
University of Pennsylvania, dating from 1740, is the
oldest of all state universities. Harvard, founded in
1636, was the first college established in the country;
and the only other American colleges which survive
from the seventeenth century are William and Mary, at
Williamsburg, Virginia, established in 1693, and St.
John's College, at Annapolis, dating from 1696.)</p>

<p>There is a tendency in some parts of the South to use
the terms "college" and "university" loosely. Some
schools for white persons, doing little if anything more
than grammar and high-school work, are called "colleges,"
and negro institutions doing similar work are
sometimes grandiloquently termed "universities."</p>

<p>Atlanta has thirteen public schools for negroes, but
no public high school for them. There are, however,
six large private educational institutions for negroes in
the city, doing high-school, college, or graduate work,
making Atlanta a great colored educational center.
Of these, Atlanta University, a non-sectarian co-educational
college with a white president (Mr. Edward
T. Ware, whose father came from New England
and founded the institution in 1867), is, I believe, the
oldest and largest. It is very highly spoken of. Atlanta
and Clark Universities are the only two colored
colleges in Atlanta listed in the "World Almanac's" table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
of American universities and colleges. Clark also has a
white man as president.</p>

<p>Spelman Seminary, a Baptist institution for colored
girls, has a white woman president, and is partially supported
by Rockefeller money. Morehouse College, for
boys, has a colored president, an able man, is of similar
denomination and is also partially supported by
Rockefeller funds. Spelman and Morehouse are run
separately, excepting in college work, on which they
combine. Both are said to be excellent. Morris
Brown University is not a university at all, but does
grammar and high-school work. It is officered and
supported by colored people, all churches of the African
Methodist Episcopal denomination subscribing funds
for its maintenance. Gammon Theological Seminary
is, I am informed, the one adequately endowed educational
establishment for negroes in Atlanta. It would,
of course, be a splendid thing if the best of these schools
and colleges could be combined.</p>

<p>Citizens of Atlanta do not, generally, take the interest
they ought to take in these or other institutions for
the benefit of negroes. To be sure, most Southerners do
not believe in higher education for negroes; but, even allowing
for that viewpoint, it is manifestly unfair that
white children should have public high schools and that
negro children should have none, but should be obliged
to pay for their education above the grammar grades.
Perhaps there are people in Atlanta who believe that
even a high-school education is undesirable for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
negro. That, however, seems to me a pretty serious
thing for one race to attempt to decide for another&mdash;especially
when the deciding race is not deeply and sincerely
interested in the uplift of the race over which it
holds the whip hand. Certainly intelligent people in
the South believe in industrial training for the negro,
and equally certainly a negro high school could give industrial
training.</p>

<p>Negroes are not admitted to Atlanta parks, nor are
there any parks exclusively for them. Until recently
there was no contagious-disease hospital to which negroes
could be taken, and there is not now a reformatory
for colored girls in the State of Georgia. Neither
is there any provision whatsoever in the State for the
care of feeble-minded colored children. And there is
one thing even worse to be said. Shameful as are
Georgia's frequent lynchings, shameful as is the State's
indifference to negro welfare, blacker yet is the law upon
her statute books making the "age of consent" <i>ten
years</i>! Various women's organizations, and individual
women, have, for decades, worked to change this law,
but without success. The term "southern chivalry"
must ring mocking and derisive in the ears of Georgia
legislators until this disgrace is wiped out. Standing
as it does, it means but one thing: that in order to protect
some white males in their depravity, the voters of
Georgia are satisfied to leave little girls, ten, eleven,
twelve years of age, and upward, white as well as colored,
utterly unprotected by the law in this regard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard more than one woman in Georgia intimate
that she would be well pleased with a little less
exterior "chivalry" and a little more plain justice.
Aside from their efforts to change the "age of consent"
law, leading women in the State have been working
for compulsory education, for the opening of the
State University to women, for factory inspection and
decent child-labor laws. The question of child labor
has now been taken in hand by the National Government&mdash;as,
of course, the "age of consent" should also
be&mdash;but in other respects but little progress has been
made in Georgia.</p>

<p>From such cheerless items I turn gladly to a happier
theme.</p>

<p>As I have said elsewhere in this book, many colored
people in Atlanta are doing well in various ways. At
Atlanta University I saw several students whose fathers
and mothers were graduates of the same institution.
Higher education for the negro has, thus, come
into its second generation. More prosperous negroes in
Atlanta are doing social settlement work among less
fortunate members of their race, and have started a free
kindergarten for negro children. Many good people in
Atlanta are unaware of these facts, and I believe their
judgment on the entire negro question would be modified,
at least in certain details, were they merely to inform
themselves upon various creditable negro activities
in the city. The northern stranger, attempting to ascertain
the truth about the negro and the negro problem,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
has to this extent the advantage of the average Southerner:
prejudice and indifference do not prevent his going
among the negroes to find out what they are doing
for themselves.</p>

<p>At various times in my life chance has thrown me
into contact with charities in great variety, and philanthropic
work of many kinds. I have seen theoretical
charities, sentimental charities, silly charities, pauperizing
charities, wild-eyed charities, charities which did
good, and others which worked damage in the world; I
have seen organized charities splendidly run under difficult
circumstances (as in the Department of Charities
under Commissioner Kingsbury, in New York
City), and I have seen other organized charities badly
run at great expense; I have seen charities conducted
with the primary purpose of ministering to the vanity
of self-important individuals who like to say: "See all
the good that I am doing!" and I have seen other personal
charities operated (as in the case of the Rockefeller
Foundation) with a perfectly magnificent scope
and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, of all the charities I have seen, of all
the efforts I have witnessed to improve the condition
of humanity, none has taken a firmer hold upon my
heart than the Leonard Street Orphans' Home, for
negro girls, in Atlanta.</p>

<p>The home is a humble frame building which was used
as a barracks by northern troops stationed in Atlanta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
after the Civil War. In it reside Miss Chadwick, her
helpers, and about seventy little negro girls; and it is an
interesting fact that several of the helpers are young
colored women who, themselves brought up in the home
and taught to be self-supporting, have been drawn back
to the place by homesickness. Was ever before an orphan
homesick for an orphans' home?</p>

<p>Miss Chadwick is an Englishwoman. Coming out to
America a good many years ago, she somehow found
Atlanta, and in Atlanta somehow found this orphanage,
which was then both figuratively and literally dropping
to pieces. Some one had to take hold of it, so Miss
Chadwick did. How successful she has been it is hard
to convey in words. I do not mean that she has succeeded
in building up a great flourishing plant with a
big endowment and all sorts of improvements. Far
from it. The home stands on a tiny lot, the building
is ramshackle and not nearly large enough for its purpose,
and sometimes it seems doubtful where the money
to keep it going will come from. Nevertheless the home
is a hundred times more successful than I could have believed
a home for orphans, colored or white, could be
made, had I not seen it with my own eyes. Its success
lies not in material possessions or prosperity, not in the
food and shelter it provides to those who so pitifully
needed it, but in the fact that it is in the truest and finest
sense a <i>home</i>, a place endowed with the greatest blessings
any home can have: contentment and affection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
What Miss Chadwick has provided is, in short, an institution
with a heart.</p>

<p>How did she do it? That, like the other mystery
of how she manages to house those seventy small lively
people in that little building, is something which only
Heaven and Miss Chadwick understand.</p>

<p>But then, if you have ever visited the home and met
Miss Chadwick, and seen her with her children, you
know that Heaven and Miss Chadwick understand a lot
of things the rest of us don't know about at all!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>A man I know studies as a hobby something which
he calls "graphics"&mdash;the term denoting the reaction
of the mind to certain words. One of
the words he used in an experiment with me was "winter."
When he said "winter" there instantly came to
me the picture of a snowstorm in Quebec. I saw the
front of the Hotel Frontenac at dusk through a mist
of driving snow. There were lights in the windows.
A heavy wind was blowing and as I leaned against it
the front of my overcoat was plastered with sticky white
flakes. The streets and sidewalks were deep with snow,
and the only person besides myself in the vision was a
sentry standing with his gun in the lee of the vestibule
outside the local militia headquarters.</p>

<p>If my friend were to come now and try me with the
word "spring," I know what picture it would call to
mind. I should see the Burge plantation, near Covington,
Georgia: the simple old white house with its rose-clad
porch, or "gallery," its grove of tall trees, its carriage-house,
its well-house, and other minor depend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>encies
clustering nearby like chickens about a white hen,
its background the rolling cottonfields, their red soil
glowing salmon-colored in the sun. For, as I was never
so conscious of the brutality of winter as in that evening
snowstorm at Quebec, I was never so conscious, as at
the time of our visit to the Burge plantation, of the
superlative soft sweetness of the spring.</p>

<span class="caption">I was never so conscious, as at the time of our visit to the Burge plantation, of the superlative soft sweetness

</div>

<p>In seasons, as in other things, we have our individual
preferences. Melancholy natures usually love autumn,
with its colorings so like sweet sad minor chords. But
what kind of natures they are which rejoice in spring,
which feel that with each spring the gloomy past is
blotted out, and life, with all its opportunities, begins
anew&mdash;what kind of natures they are which recognize
April instead of January as the beginning of their year
I shall not attempt to tell, for mine is such a nature, and
one must not act at once as subject and diagnostician.</p>

<p>So long as I endure, spring can never come again
without turning my thoughts to northwestern Georgia;
to the peculiar penetrating warmth which passed
through the clothing to the body and made one feel that
one was not surrounded by mere air, but was immersed
in a dry bath of some infinitely superior vapor, a vapor
volatile, soothing, tonic, distilled, it seemed, from the
earth, from pine trees, tulip trees, balm-of-Gilead trees,
(or "bam" trees, as they call them), blossoming Judas
trees, Georgia crabapple, dogwood pink and white, peach
blossom, wistaria, sweet-shrub, dog violets, pansy violets,
Cherokee roses, wild honeysuckle and azalia, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
evanescent green of new treetops, all carried in solution
in the sunlight. By day the brilliant cardinal adds his
fine note of color and sound, but at night he is silent,
and when the moon comes out one hears the mockingbird
and, it may be also, two whippoorwills, one in the
grove near the house, one in the woods across the road,
calling back and forth. Then one is tempted to step
down from the porch, and follow the voices of the birds
into the vague recesses of a night webbed with dark tree
shadows outlined in blue moonlight.</p>

<p>Small wonder it is, if, as report says, no houseparty
on a southern plantation is a success unless young
couples become "sort of engaged," and if in a region so
provocative in springtime under a full moon, a distinction
is recognized between being merely "engaged," and
being engaged <i>to be married</i>.</p>

<p>One Georgia belle we met, a sloe-eyed girl whose reputation
not only for beauty but for charm reached through
the entire South, had, at the time of our visit, recently
become engaged in the more grave and permanent sense.</p>

<p>"How does it seem?" a girl friend asked her.</p>

<p>"I feel," she answered, "like a man who has built up a
large business and is about to go into the hands of a receiver."</p>

<p>Such ways as those girls have! Such voices! Such
eyes! And such names, too! Names which would not
fit at all into a northern setting, relatively so hard and
unsentimental, but which, when one becomes accustomed
to them, take their place gracefully and harmoniously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in the southern picture. The South likes diminutives
and combinations in its women's names. Its Harriets,
Franceses, Sarahs, and Marthas, become Hatties, Fannies,
Sallies and Patsies, and Patsy sometimes undergoes
a further transition and becomes Passie. Moreover,
where these diminutives have been passed down
for several generations in a family, their origin is sometimes
lost sight of, and the diminutive becomes the actual
baptismal name. In one family of my acquaintance, for
example, the name Passie has long been handed down
from mother to daughter. The original great-grandmother
Passie was christened Martha but was at first
called Patsy; then, because her black mammy was also
named Patsy, the daughter of the house came to be
known, for purposes of differentiation, as Passie, and
when she married and had a daughter of her own, the
child was christened Passie. In this family the name
May has more recently been adopted as a middle name,
and it is customary for familiars of the youngest Passie,
to address her not merely as Passie, but as Passie-May.
The inclusion of the second name, in this fashion, is another
custom not uncommon in the South. In Atlanta
alone I heard of ladies habitually referred to as Anna-Laura,
Hattie-May, Lollie-Belle, Sally-Maud, Nora-Belle,
Mattie-Sue, Emma-Belle, Lottie-Belle, Susie-May,
Lula-Belle, Sallie-Fannie, Hattie-Fannie, Lou-Ellen,
Allie-Lou, Clara-Belle, Mary-Ella, and Hattie-Belle.
Another young lady was known to her friends as
Jennie-D.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>The train from Atlanta set us down at Covington,
Georgia, or rather at the station which lies between the
towns of Covington and Oxford&mdash;for when this railroad
was built neither town would allow it a right of
way, and to this day each is connected with the station
by a street car line, either line equipped with one diminutive
car, a pair of disconsolate mules, and a driver.
Covington is the County seat, a quiet southern town,
part old, part new, with a look of rural prosperity about
it. Stopping at the postoffice to inquire for mail we saw
this peremptory sign displayed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When the window is down don't bang around and
ask for a stamp or two.</p>

<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.&nbsp;L. Callaway</span>, Postmaster.</p></div>

<p>As the window was down we tiptoed out and went
upon our way, driving through Oxford before going to
the plantation. This town was named for Oxford, England,
and is, like its namesake, a college town. A small
and very old Methodist educational institution, with a
pretty though ragged campus and fine trees, is all there
is to Oxford, save a row of ante-bellum houses. One
of them, a pleasant white mansion, half concealed by the
huge magnolias which stand in its front yard, was
at one time the residence of General Longstreet. The
old front gate, hanging on a stone post, was made by the
general with his own hands&mdash;and well made, for it is to-day
as good a gate as ever. Corra Harris lived at one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
time in Oxford; her husband, Rev. Lundy H. Harris,
having been a professor at the college.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Though plantation life has necessarily changed since
the war, I do not believe that there is in the whole South
a plantation where it has changed less than on the Burge
plantation. In appearance the place is not as Sherman's
men found it, for they tore down the fences and
ruined the beautiful old-fashioned garden, and neither
has been replaced; nor, of course, is it run, so far as
practical affairs are concerned, as it was before the
War; that is to say, instead of being operated as a
unit of nine-hundred acres, it is now worked chiefly
on shares, and is divided up into "one mule farms"
and "two mule farms," these being tracts of about
thirty and sixty acres, respectively, thirty acres being
approximately the area which can be worked by a man
and a mule.</p>

<p>Practically all the negroes on the place&mdash;perhaps a
hundred in number&mdash;are either former slaves of the
Burge family, or the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
of slaves who lived on the plantation.
That is one reason why the plantation is less changed in
spirit than are many others. The Burges were religious
people, used their slaves kindly, and brought them up
well, so that the negroes on the plantation to-day are respectable,
and in some instances, exemplary people, very
different from the vagrant negro type which has developed
since the War, making labor conditions in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
parts of the South uncertain, and plantation life, in some
sections, not safe for unprotected women.</p>

<p>The present proprietors of the Burge plantation are
two ladies, granddaughters of Mrs. Thomas Burge, who
lived here, a widow, with a little daughter, when General
Sherman and his hosts came by. These ladies frequently
spend months at the plantation without male protectors
save only the good negroes of their own place,
who look after them with the most affectionate devotion.
True, the ladies keep an ugly looking but mild mannered
bulldog, of which the negroes are generally afraid; true
also they carry a revolver when they drive about the
country in their motor, and keep revolvers handy in their
rooms; but these precautions are not taken, they told
me, because of any doubts about the men on their place,
their one fear being of tramp negroes, passing by.</p>

<p>Of their own negroes several are remarkable, particularly
one old couple, perfect examples of the fine
ante-bellum type so much beloved in the South, and so
much regretted as it disappears.</p>

<p>During the period of twenty years or more, while the
owners were absent, growing up and receiving their
education, the whole place, indoors and out, was in
charge of Uncle George and Aunt Sidney. The two
lived, and still do live, in one wing of the house&mdash;over
which Aunt Sidney presides as housekeeper and
cook, as her mother, Aunt Liddy, did before her. Aunt
Liddy died only a short time ago, aged several years
over a hundred. Uncle George supervises all the busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>ness
of the plantation, as he has done for thirty or forty
years. He collects all rents, markets the crops and receives
the payments, makes purchases, pays bills, and
keeps peace between the tenants&mdash;nor could any human
being be more honorable or possess a finer, sweeter dignity.
As for devotion, when the little girls who were
away returned after all the years as grown women, every
ribbon, every pin in that house was where it had been
left, and the place was no less neat than if the "white
folks" had constantly remained there.</p>

<p>Before Georgia went dry it was customary for negroes
of the rougher sort to get drunk in town every Saturday
night. Drunken negroes would consequently be passing
by, all night, on their way to their homes, yelling and
(after the manner of their kind when intoxicated) shooting
their revolvers in the air. Every Saturday night,
when the ladies were at home, Uncle George would
quietly take his gun and place himself on the porch,
remaining there until the last of the obstreperous wayfarers
had passed.</p>

<p>Uncle Abe and Uncle Wiley are two other worthy and
venerable men who live in cabins on the place. Both
were there when Sherman's army passed upon its devastating
way, and both were carried off, as were thousands
upon thousands of other negroes out of that wide
belt across the State of Georgia, which was overrun
in the course of the March to the Sea.</p>

<p>"Ah was goin' to mill wid de ox-caht," Uncle Abe
told me, "when de soljas dey kim 'long an' got me. Dey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
tol' me, 'Heah, nigga! Git out dat caht, an' walk behin'.
When <i>it</i> moves <i>you</i> move; when <i>it</i> stops <i>you</i>
stop!' An' like dat Ah walk all de way to Savannah
[two hundred and fifty miles]. Den, after dat, dey took
us 'long up No'th&mdash;me an' ma brotha Wiley, ovah deh."</p>

<p>I asked him what regiment he went with. He said it
was the Twenty-second Indiana, and that Dr. Joe Stilwell,
of that regiment, who came from a place near Madison,
Indiana ("Ah reckon de town was name Brownstown"),
was good to him. An officer whom he knew, he
said, was Captain John Snodgrass, and another Major
Tom Shay.</p>

<p>"All Ah was evvuh wo'ied about aftuh dey kim tuck
me," he declared, "was gittin' somep'n t' eat. Dat kinda
put me on de wonduh, sometahmes, but dey used us all
right. Dr. Pegg&mdash;him dat did de practice on de plantation
befo' de Wah&mdash;he tol' de niggas dat de Yankees
would put gags in deh moufs an' lead 'em eroun' like dey
wuz cattle. But deh wa' n't like dat nohow. I b'longed
to de Secon' Division, Thuhd B'gade, Fou'teenth Co'
[corps]. Cap'n Snodgrass, he got to be lieutenant-cuhnel.
He was de highes' man Ah evuh hel' any convuhsation
wid, but I <i>saw</i> all de gennuls of dat ahmy."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiley is older than Uncle Abe. He was already
a grown man with three children when taken away
by some of Sherman's men. He told me he was with the
Fifty-second Ohio, and mentioned Captain Shepard.</p>

<p>The two brothers got as far as Washington, D.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>"We got los' togedduh in de U.&nbsp;S. buildin' in dat city,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
said Uncle Wiley. "De President of de U.&nbsp;S. right at
dat tahme he was daid. He was kill', Ah don' s'pose
it wuz a week befo' we got to Wash'n, D.&nbsp;C."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come all the way back?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Well-l," ruminated the old man, "home was always
a-restin' on mah min'. Ah kep' thinkin' 'bout home.
So aftuh de Wah ceasted Ah jus' kim 'long back."</p>

<p>Many of the old plantation customs still survive. A
little before noon the bell is rung to summon the hands
from the cotton fields. Over the red plowed soil you
hear a darky cry, a melodious "Oh-<i>oh</i>-oh!" as wild and
musical as the cries of the south-Italian olive gatherers.
The planters cease their work, mules stand still, traces
are unhooked from singletrees, and chain-ends thrown
over the mules' backs; then the men mount the animals
and ride in to the midday meal, the women trudging
after. Those who rent land, or work on shares, go to
their own cabins, while those employed by the hour or
by the day (the rate of pay is ten cents an hour or seventy-five
cents a day) come to the kitchen to be fed.
Nor is it customary to stop there at feeding negroes.
As in the old days, any negro who has come upon an
errand or who has "stopped by" to sell supplies, or for
whatever purpose, expects to stay for "dinner," and
makes it a point to arrive about noon. Thus from
sixteen to twenty negroes are fed daily at the Burge
plantation house.</p>

<p>The old Christmas traditions are likewise kept up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
On Christmas day the negroes come flocking up to the
house for their gifts. Their first concern is to attempt
to cry "Christmas gift!" to others, before it can be said
to them&mdash;for according to ancient custom the one who
says the words first must have a gift from the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<br />
A YOUNG METROPOLIS</h2>


<p>An observer approaching a strange city should be
"neutral even in thought." He may listen to
what is said of the city, but he must not permit
his opinions to take form in advance; for, like other
gossip, gossip about cities is unreliable, and the casual
stranger's estimate of cities is not always founded upon
broad appreciations. But though it is unwise to judge
of cities by what is said of them, it is perhaps worth
remarking that one may often judge of men by what they
say of cities.</p>

<p>I remember an American manufacturer, broken down
by overwork, who, when he looked at Pompeii, could
think only of the wasted possibilities of Vesuvius as a
power plant, and I remember two traveling salesmen
on a southern railroad train who expressed scorn for
the exquisite city of Charleston because&mdash;they said&mdash;it
is but a poor market place for suspenders and barbers'
supplies. There are those who think of Boston only as
headquarters of the shoe trade, others who think of it
only in the terms of culture, and still others who regard
it solely as an abode of negrophiles.</p>

<p>In the case of the chief city of Alabama, however, my
companion and I noticed, as we journeyed through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
South, that reports were singularly in accord. Birmingham
is too young to have any Civil War history.
Her history is the history of the steel industry in the
South, and one hears always of that: of the affluence of
the city when the industry is thriving, and hard times
when it is not. One is invariably told that Birmingham
is not a southern city, but a northern city in the
South, and the chief glories of the place, aside from
steel, are (if one is to believe rumors current upon railroad
trains and elsewhere), a twenty-seven story building,
Senator Oscar Underwood, the distinguished Democratic
leader, and the Tutwiler Hotel. Even in Atlanta
it is conceded that the Tutwiler is a good hotel, and when
Atlanta admits that anything in Birmingham is good it
may be considered as established that the thing is very,
very good&mdash;for Birmingham and Atlanta view each
other with the same degree of cordiality as is exchanged
between St. Louis and Kansas City, Minneapolis and St.
Paul, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Having been, in the course of our southern wanderings,
in several very bad hotels, and having heard the
Tutwiler compared with Chicago's Blackstone, my companion
and I held eager anticipation of this hostelry.
Nor were our hopes dashed by a first glimpse of the city
on the night of our arrival. It was a modern-looking
city&mdash;just the sort of city that would have a fine new
hotel. The railroad station through which we passed
after leaving the train was not the usual dingy little
southern station, but an admirable building, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
streets along which we presently found ourselves gliding
in an automobile hack, were wide, smooth, and brightly
illuminated by clustered boulevard lights.</p>

<p>True, we had long since learned not to place
too much reliance upon the nocturnal aspects of
cities. A city seen by night is like a woman dressed for
a ball. Darkness drapes itself about her as a black-velvet
evening gown, setting off, in place of neck and
arms, the softly glowing fa&ccedil;ades of marble buildings;
lights are her diamond ornaments, and her perfume is
the cool fragrance of night air. Almost all cities, and
almost all women, look their best at night, and there are
those which, though beautiful by night, sink, in their
daylight aspect, to utter mediocrity.</p>

<p>Presently our motor drew up before the entrance of
the Tutwiler&mdash;a proud entrance, all revolving doors and
glitter and promise. A brisk bell boy came running for
our bags. The signs were of the best.</p>

<p>The lobby, though spacious, was crowded; the decorations
and equipment were of that rich sumptuousness
attained only in the latest and most magnificent American
hotels; there was music, and as we made our way
along we caught a glimpse, in passing, of an attractive
supper room, with small table-lights casting their soft
radiance upon white shirt fronts and the faces of pretty
girls. In all it was a place to make glad the heart of
the weary traveler, and to cause him to wonder whether
his dress suit would be wrinkled when he took it from
his trunk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind the imposing marble "desk" stood several impeccable
clerks, and to one of these I addressed myself,
giving our names and mentioning the fact that we had
telegraphed for rooms. I am not sure that this young
man wore a braided cutaway and a white carnation; I
only know that he affected me as hotel clerks in braided
cutaways and white carnations always do. While I
spoke he stood a little way back from the counter, his
chin up, his gaze barely missing the top of my hat, his
nostrils seeming to contract with that expression of
dubiousness assumed by delicate noses which sense, long
before they encounter it, the aroma of unworthiness.</p>

<p>"Not a room in the house," he said. Then, as though
to forestall further parley, he turned and spoke with
gracious lightness to one of his own rank and occupation
who, at the request of my companion, was ascertaining
whether letters were awaiting us.</p>

<p>"But we telegraphed two days ago!" I protested desperately.</p>

<p>"Can't help it. Hardware Convention. Everything
taken."</p>

<p>Over my shoulder I heard from my companion a
sound, half sigh, half groan, which echoed the cry of
my own heart.</p>

<p>"I felt this coming!" he murmured. "Didn't you notice
all these people with ribbons on them? There's
never any room in a hotel where everybody's wearing
ribbons. It's like a horse show. They get the ribbons
and we get the gate."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely," I faltered, "you can let us have one small
room?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," he answered brightly. "We've turned
away dozens of people this evening."</p>

<p>"Then," I said, abandoning hope, "perhaps you will
suggest some other hotel?"</p>

<p>I once heard a woman, the most perfect parvenu I
ever met, speak of her poor relations in a tone exactly
similar to that in which the clerk now spoke the names
of two hotels. Having spoken, he turned and passed behind
the partition at one end of the marble counter.</p>

<p>My companion and I stood there for a moment looking
despondently at each other. Then, without a word, we
retreated through that gorgeous lobby, feeling like sad
remnants of a defeated Yankee army.</p>

<p>Again we motored through the bright streets, but only
to successive disappointments, for both hotels mentioned
by the austere clerk were "turning 'em away."
Our chauffeur now came to our aid, mentioning several
small hotels, and in one of these, the Granada, we were
at last so fortunate as to find lodgings.</p>

<p>"It begun to look like you'd have to put up at the
Roden," the chauffeur smiled as we took our bags out of
the car and settled with him.</p>

<p>"The Roden?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned "Best ventilated hotel in the
United States."</p>

<p>Next day when the Hotel Roden was pointed out to
us we appreciated the witticism, for the Roden is&mdash;or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
was at the time of our visit&mdash;merely the steel skeleton
of a building which, we were informed, had for some
years stood unfinished owing to disagreements among
those concerned with its construction.</p>

<p>As for the Granada, though a modest place, it was
new and clean; the clerk was amiable, the beds comfortable,
and if our rooms were too small to admit our
trunks, they were, at all events, outside rooms, each with
a private bath, at a rate of $1 per day apiece. Never
in any hotel have I felt that I was getting so much for
my money.</p>

<p>Next morning, after breakfast, we set out to see the
city. Having repeatedly heard of Birmingham as the
"Pittsburgh of the South," we expected cold daylight
to reveal the sooty signs of her industrialism, but in this
we were agreeably disappointed. By day as well as by
night the city is pleasing to the eye, and it is a fact
worth noting that the downtown buildings of Atlanta
(which is not an industrial city) are streaked and dirty,
whereas those of Birmingham are clean&mdash;the reason for
this being that the mills and furnaces of Birmingham
are far removed from the heart of the town, whereas
locomotives belch black smoke into the very center of
Atlanta's business and shopping district.</p>

<p>Moreover, the metropolis of Alabama is better laid
out than that of Georgia. The streets of Birmingham
are wide, and the business part of the city, lying upon a
flat terrain, is divided into large, even squares. From
this district the chief residence section mounts by easy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
graceful grades into the hills to the southward. Because
of these grades, and the curving drives which follow
the contours of the hills, and the vistas of the lower
city, and the good modern houses, and the lawns and
trees and shrubbery and breezes, this Highlands region
is reminiscent of a similar residence district in Portland,
Oregon&mdash;which is to say that it is one of the most agreeable
districts of the kind in the United States.</p>

<p>Well up on the hillside, Highland Avenue winds a
charming course between pleasant homes, with here and
there a little residence park branching off to one side,
and here and there a small municipal park occupying an
angle formed by a sharp turn in the driveway; and if
you follow the street far enough you will presently see
the house of the Birmingham Country Club, standing
upon its green hilltop, amidst rolling, partly wooded golf
links, above the road.</p>

<p>Nor is the Country Club at the summit of this range
of hills. Back of it rise other roads, the most picturesque
of them being Altamont Road, which runs to
the top of Red Mountain, reaching a height about
equivalent to that of the cornice line of Birmingham's
tallest building. The houses of this region are built on
streets which, like some streets of Portland, are terraced
into the hillside, and the resident of an upper block
can almost look down the chimneys of his neighbors on
the block below. The view commanded from these
mountain perches does not suggest that the lower city
runs up into the Highlands. It seems to be a separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
place, down in a distant valley, and the sense of its remoteness
is heightened by the thin veil of gray smoke
which wafts from the tall smokestacks of far-off iron
furnaces, softening the serrated outlines of the city and
wrapping its tall buildings in the industrial equivalent
for autumn haze.</p>

<span class="caption">Birmingham&mdash;The thin veil of smoke from far-off iron furnaces softens the city&#39;s serrated outlines</span>
</div>

<p>At night the scene from the Highlands is even more
spectacular, for at brief intervals the blowing of a converter
in some distant steel plant illuminates the heavens
with a great hot glow, like that which rises and falls
about the crater of a volcano in eruption. Thus the
city's vast affairs are kept before it by day in a pillar of
cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire. Iron and steel
dominate Birmingham's mind, activities and life. The
very ground of Red Mountain is red because of the iron
ore that it contains, and those who reside upon the
charming slopes of this hill do not own their land in fee
simple, but subject always to the mineral rights of mining
companies.</p>

<p>The only other industry of Birmingham which is to
be compared, in magnitude or efficiency, with the steel
industry is that of "cutting in" at dances. All through
the South it is carried on, but whereas in such cities as
Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta, men show a little
mercy to the stranger&mdash;realizing that, as he is presumably
unacquainted with all the ladies at a dance, he
cannot retaliate in kind&mdash;Birmingham is merciless and
prosecutes the pestilential practice unremittingly, even
going so far as to apply the universal-service principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
and call out her highschool youths to carry on the work.
Before I went to certain dances in Birmingham I felt
that high-school boys ought to be kept at home at night,
but after attending these dances I realized that such
restriction was altogether inadequate, and that the only
way to deal with them effectively would be to pickle them
in vitriol.</p>

<span class="caption">Birmingham practices unremittingly the pestilential habit of &quot;cutting in&quot; at
dances</span>
</div>

<p>Where, in other cities of the South, I have managed
to dance as much as half a dance without interruption, I
never danced more than twenty feet with one partner in
Birmingham. Nor did my companion.</p>

<p>Our host was energetic in presenting us to ladies of
infinite pulchritude and State-wide terpsichorean reputation,
but we would start to tread a measure with them,
only to have them swiftly snatched from us by some
spindle-necked, long-wristed, big-boned, bowl-eared
high-school youth, in a dinner suit which used to fit him
when it was new, six months ago.</p>

<p>As we would start to dance the lady would say:</p>

<p>"You-all ah strangehs, ahn't you?"</p>

<p>We would reply that we were.</p>

<p>"Wheh do you come from?"</p>

<p>"New York."</p>

<p>Then, because the Hardware Convention was being
held in town at the time, she would continue:</p>

<p>"Ah reckon you-all ah hahdware men?"</p>

<p>But that was as far as the conversation ever got.
Just about the time that she began to reckon we were
hardware men a mandatory hand would be laid upon us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
and before we had time to defend ourselves against the
hardware charge, the lady would be wafted off in the
arms of some predatory youth who ought to have been at
home considering <i>pons asinorum</i>.</p>

<p>Had we indeed been hardware men, and had we had
our hardware with us, they could have done with fewer
teachers in the high schools of that city after the night
of our first dance in Birmingham.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Up in the hills, some miles back of the Country Club,
on the banks of a large artificial lake, stands the new
clubhouse of the Birmingham Motor and Country Club,
and around the lake runs the club's two-and-a-half-mile
speedway. Elsewhere is the Roebuck Golf Club, the
links of which are admitted ("even in Atlanta!") to be
excellent&mdash;the one possible objection to the course of the
Birmingham Country Club being that it is suited only
to play with irons.</p>

<p>I mention these golfing matters not because they interest
me, but because they may interest you. I am not
a golfer. I played the game for two seasons; then I
decided to try to lead a better life. The first time I
played I did quite well, but thence onward my game
declined until, toward the last, crowds would collect to
hear me play. When I determined to abandon the game
I did not burn my clubs or break them up, according to
the usual custom, but instead gave them to a man upon
whom I wished to retaliate because his dog had bitten
a member of my family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Small wonder that all golf clubs have extensive bars!
It is not hard to understand why men who realize that
they have become incurable victims of the insidious habit
of golf should wish to drown the thought in drink. But
in Birmingham they can't do it&mdash;not, at least, at bars.
Alabama has beaten her public bars into soda fountains
and quick-lunch rooms, and though her club bars
still look like real ones, the drinks served are so soft that
no splash occurs when reminiscent tears drop into them.</p>

<p>When we were in Alabama each citizen who so desired
was allowed by law to import from outside the
State a small allotment of strong drink for personal use,
but the red tape involved in this procedure had already
discouraged all but the most ardent drinkers, and
those found it next to impossible, even by hoarding their
"lonesome quarts," and pooling supplies with their convivial
friends, to provide sufficient alcoholic drink for
a "real party."</p>

<p>We met in Birmingham but one gentleman whose
cellars seemed to be well stocked, and the tales of ingenuity
and exertion by which he managed to secure
ample supplies of liquor were such as to lead us to believe
that this matter had become, with him, an occupation
to which all other business must give second place.</p>

<p>It was this gentleman who told us that, since the State
went dry, the ancient form, "R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;P.," on social invitations,
had been revised to "B.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P.," signifying,
"bring whisky in hip pocket."</p>

<p>To the "B.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P." habit he himself strictly ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>hered.
One night, when we chanced to meet him in a
downtown club, he drew a flask from a hip pocket, and
invited us to "have something."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked my companion.</p>

<p>"Scotch."</p>

<p>When my companion had helped himself he passed
the flask to me, but I returned it to the owner, explaining
that I did not drink Scotch whisky.</p>

<p>"What do you drink?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Bourbon."</p>

<p>"Here it is," he returned, drawing a second flask from
the other hip pocket.</p>

<p>How well, too, do I remember the long, delightful
evening upon which my companion and I sat in an Atlanta
club with a group of the older members, the week
before Georgia went bone dry. There, as in Alabama
before 1915, there had been pretended prohibition, but
now the bars of leading clubs were being closed, and
convivial men were looking into the future with despair.
One of the gentlemen was a justice of the Supreme
Court of the State, and I remember his wistful
declaration that prohibition would fall hardest upon the
older men.</p>

<p>"When a man is young," he said, "he can be lively and
enjoy himself without drinking, because he is full of animal
spirits. But we older men aren't bubbling over
with liveliness. We can't dance, or don't want to, and
we lack the stimulus which comes of falling continually
in love. My great pleasure is to sit of an evening, here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
at a table in the caf&eacute; of this club, conversing with my
friends. That is where prohibition is going to hurt me.
I shall not see my old friends any more."</p>

<p>The others protested at this somber view, but the
judge gravely shook his head, saying: "You don't believe
me, but I know whereof I speak, for I have been
through something like this, in a minor way, before.
A good many years ago I was one of a little group of
congenial men to organize a small club. We had comfortable
quarters, and we used to drop in at night, much
as we have been doing of late years here, and have the
kind of talks that are tonic to the soul. Of course we
had liquor in the club, but there came a time when, for
some reason or other&mdash;I think it was some trouble over
a license&mdash;we closed our bar. We didn't think it was
going to make a great difference, but it did. The men
began to stop coming in, and before long the club ceased
to exist.</p>

<p>"It won't be like that here. This club will go on.
But we won't come here. We won't want to sit around
a table, like this, and drink ginger ale and sarsaparilla;
and even if we do, the talk won't be so good. The thing
that makes me downcast is not that liquor is going, but
that we are really parting this week.</p>

<p>"Every one knows that the abuse of drink does harm
in the world, but these pious prohibitionists are not of the
temperament to understand how alcohol ministers to the
esthetic side of certain natures. It gives us better companions
and makes us better companions for others. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
stimulates our minds, enhances our appreciations, sharpens
our wit, loosens our tongues, and saves brilliant
conversation from becoming a lost art."</p>

<p>My sympathies went out to the judge. It has always
seemed to me a pity that the liquor question has resolved
itself into a fight between extremists&mdash;for I think the
wine and beer people might survive if they were not tied
up with the distillers, and I do not believe that any considerable
evil comes of drinking wine or beer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it must be apparent to every one who
troubles to investigate, that prohibition invariably works
great good wherever it is made effective. Take, for
example, Birmingham.</p>

<p>There was one year&mdash;I believe it was 1912&mdash;when
there was an average of more than one murder a day,
for every working day in the year, in the county in
which Birmingham is located. On one famous Saturday
night there were nineteen felonious assaults (sixteen
by negroes and three by whites), from which about
a dozen deaths resulted, two of those killed having been
policemen.</p>

<p>All this has changed with prohibition. Killings are
now comparatively rare, arrests have diminished to less
than a third of the former average, whether for grave
or petty offenses, and the receiving jail, which was formerly
packed like a pigpen every Saturday night, now
stands almost empty, while the city jail, which used
continually to house from 120 to 150 offenders, has
diminished its average population to 30 or 35.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<br />
BUSY BIRMINGHAM</h2>


<p>The fact that a man may shut off his motor and
coast downhill from his home to his office in
the lower part of Birmingham, is not without
symbolism. Birmingham is all business. If I were to
personify the place, it would be in the likeness of a man
I know&mdash;a big, powerful fellow with an honest blue
eye and an expression in which self-confidence, ambition,
and power are blended. Like Birmingham, this
man is a little more than forty years of age. Like Birmingham,
he has built up a large business of his own.
And, like Birmingham, he is a little bit na&iuml;ve in his pride
of success. His life is divided between his office and
his home, and it would be difficult to say for which his
devotion is the greater. He talks business with his wife
at breakfast and dinner, and on their Sunday walks.
He brings his papers home at night and goes over them
with her, for, though her specialty is bringing up the
children, she is deeply interested in his business and
often makes suggestions which he follows. This causes
him to admire her intensely, which he would not necessarily
do were she merely a good wife and mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>He has no hobbies or pastimes. True, he plays golf,
but with him golf is not a diversion. He plays because
he finds the exercise increases his efficiency ("efficiency"
is perhaps his favorite word), and because many of his
commercial associates are golfers, and he can talk business
with them on the links.</p>

<p>His house is pleasant and stands upon a good-sized
city lot. It is filled with very shiny mahogany furniture
and strong-colored porti&egrave;res and sofa cushions. It is
rather more of a house than he requires, for his tastes
are simple, but he has a feeling that he ought to have a
large house, for the same reason that he and his wife
ought to dress expensively&mdash;that is, out of respect, as it
were, to his business.</p>

<p>One of his chief treasures is an automatic piano,
upon which he rolls off selections from Wagner's operas.
He likes the music of the great German because, as he
has often told me, it stirs his imagination, thereby helping
him to solve business problems and make business
plans.</p>

<p>The thing he most abhors is general conversation, and
he is never so amusing&mdash;so pathetically and unconsciously
amusing&mdash;as when trying to take part in general
conversation and at the same time to conceal the
writhings of his tortured spirit. There is but one thing
which will drive him to attempt the feat, and that is the
necessity of making himself agreeable to some man, or
the wife of some man, from whom he wishes to get business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p>The census of 1910 gave Birmingham a population of
132,000, and it is estimated that since that time the population
has increased by 50,000. Birmingham not only
knows that it is growing, but believes in trying to make
ready in advance for future growth. It gives one the
impression that it is rather ahead of its housing problems
than behind them. Its area, for instance, is about
as great as that of Boston or Cleveland, and its hotels
may be compared with the hotels of those cities. If it
has not so many clubs as Atlanta, it has, at least, all the
clubs it needs; and if it has not so many skyscrapers as
New York, it has several which would fit nicely into the
Wall Street district. Moreover, the tall buildings of
Birmingham lose nothing in height by contrast with the
older buildings, three or four stories high, which surround
them, giving the business district something of
that look which hangs about a boy who has outgrown
his clothing. Nor are the vehicles and street crowds, altogether
in consonance, as yet, with the fine office buildings
of the city, for many of the motors standing at the
curb have about them that gray, rural look which comes
of much mud and infrequent washing, and the idlers
who lean against the rich fa&ccedil;ades of granite and marble
are entirely out of the picture, for they look precisely
like the idlers who lean against the wooden posts of
country railroad station platforms.</p>

<p>Such curious contrasts as these may be noted everywhere.
For instance, Birmingham has been so busy
paving the streets that it seems quite to have forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
to put up street signs. Also, not far from the majestic
Tutwiler Hotel, and the imposing apartment building
called the Ridgely, the front of which occupies a full
block, is a park so ill kept that it would be a disgrace
to the city but for the obvious fact that the city is growing
and wide-awake, and will, of course, attend to the
park when it can find the time. Here are, I believe, the
only public monuments Birmingham contains. One is
a Confederate monument in the form of an obelisk, and
the other two are statues erected in memory of Mary
A. Cahalan, for many years principal of the Powell
School, and of William Elias B. Davis, a distinguished
surgeon. Workers in these fields are too seldom honored
in this way, and the spirit which prompted the
erection of these monuments is particularly creditable;
sad to say, however, both effigies are wretchedly placed
and are in themselves exceedingly poor things. Art is
something, indeed, about which Birmingham has much
to learn. So far as I could discover, no such thing as an
art museum has been contemplated. But here again the
critic should remember that, whereas art is old, Birmingham
is young. She is as yet in the stage of development
at which cities think not of art museums, but of
municipal auditoriums; and with the latter subject, at
least, she is now concerning herself.</p>

<p>Even in the city's political life contrasts are not wanting,
for though the town is Republican in sentiment, it
proves itself southern by voting the Democratic ticket,
and it is interesting to note further that the commission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
by which it is governed had as one of its five members,
when we were there, a Socialist.</p>

<p>Another curious and individual touch is contributed
by the soda-fountain lunch rooms which abound in the
city, and which, I judge, arrived with the disappearance
of barroom lunch counters. In connection with
many of the downtown soda fountains there are cooking
arrangements, and business lunches are served.</p>

<p>The roads leading out of the city in various directions
have many dangerous grade crossings, and accidents
must be of common occurrence. At all events, I
have never known a city in which cemeteries and undertaking
establishments were so widely advertised. In
the street cars, for instance, I observed the cheerful
placards of one Wallace Johns, undertaker, who
promises "all the attention you would expect from a
friend," and I was informed that Mr. Johns possesses
business cards (for restricted use only) bearing the gay
legend: "I'll get you yet!"</p>

<p>As to schools the city is well off. Dr. J.&nbsp;H.
Phillips, superintendent of public schools, has occupied
his post probably as long as any school superintendent in
the country. He organized the city school system in
1883, beginning with seven teachers, as against 750 now
employed. The colored schools are reported to be better
than in most southern cities.</p>

<p>Of the general status of the negro in Birmingham
I cannot speak with authority. As in Atlanta, negroes
are sometimes required to use separate elevators in of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>fice
buildings, and, as everywhere south of Washington,
the Birmingham street cars give one end to whites
and the other to negroes. But whereas negroes use
the back of the car in Atlanta, they use the front in
Birmingham. It was attempted, at one time, to reverse
this order, for reasons having to do with draft and
ventilation, but the people of Birmingham had become
accustomed to the existing arrangement and objected
to the change. "After all," one gentleman said to me,
in speaking of this matter, "it is not important which
end of the car is given to the nigger. The main point is
that he must sit where he is told."</p>

<p>The means by which the negro vote is eliminated in
various Southern States are generally similar, though
Alabama has, perhaps, been more thorough in the matter
than some other States. The importance of this
issue to the southern white man is very great, for if all
negroes were allowed to vote the control of certain
States would be in negro hands. To the Southerner
such an idea is intolerable, and it is my confident belief
that if the State of Alabama were resettled by men
from Massachusetts, and the same problems were presented
to those men, they would be just as quick as the
white Alabamans of to-day to find means to suppress
the negro vote. With all my heart I wish that such
an exchange of citizens might temporarily be effected,
for when the immigrants from Massachusetts moved
back to their native New England, after an experience
of the black belt, they would take with them an under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>standing
of certain aspects of the negro problem
which they have never understood; an understanding
which, had they possessed it sixty or seventy years ago,
might have brought about the freeing of slaves by government
purchase&mdash;a course which Lincoln advocated
and which would probably have prevented
the Civil War, and thereby saved millions upon
millions of money, to say nothing of countless
lives. Had they even understood the problems of the
South at the end of the Civil War, the horrors of Reconstruction
might have been avoided, and I cannot too
often reiterate that, but for Reconstruction we should
not be perplexed, to-day, by the unhappy, soggy mass
of political inertia known as the Solid South.</p>

<p>I asked a former State official how the negro vote
had been eliminated in Alabama. "At first," he said,
"we used to kill them to keep them from voting; when
we got sick of doing that we began to steal their ballots;
and when stealing their ballots got to troubling our
consciences we decided to handle the matter legally, fixing
it so they couldn't vote."</p>

<p>I inquired as to details. He explained.</p>

<p>It seems that in 1901 a constitutional convention
was held, at which it was enacted that, in order to be
eligible for life to vote, citizens must register during
the next two years. There were, however, certain qualifications
prescribed for registration. A man must be
of good character, and must have fought in a war, or
be the descendant of a person who had fought. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
enactment, known as the "grandfather clause," went
far toward the elimination of the negro. As an additional
safeguard, however, an educational clause was
added, but the educational requirement did not become
effective at once, as that would have made illiterate
whites ineligible as voters. Not until the latter were
safely registered under the "grandfather clause," was
the educational clause applied, and as, under this clause,
the would-be voter must read and write <i>to the satisfaction
of his examiner</i>, the negro's chance to get suffrage
was still more reduced.</p>

<p>The United States Supreme Court has, I believe, held
that the educational clause does not constitute race discrimination.</p>

<p>As though the above measures were not sufficient, it
is further required that, in order to vote at November
elections in Alabama, voters must pay a small voluntary
poll tax. This tax, however, must be paid each
year before February first&mdash;that is, about nine months
before elections actually take place. The negro has
never been distinguished for his foresightedness with a
dollar, and, to make matters harder for him, this tax is
cumulative from the year 1901, so that a man who
wishes to begin to vote this year, and can qualify in
other respects, must pay a tax amounting to nearly
twenty dollars.</p>

<p>These measures give Alabama, as my informant put
it, a "very exclusive electorate." With a population
of approximately two millions, the greatest number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
votes ever cast by the State was 125,000. Of this number,
531 votes were those of negroes, "representing" a
colored population of 840,000!</p>

<p>The gentleman who explained these matters also told
me a story illustrative of the old-time Southerner's attitude
toward the negro in politics.</p>

<p>During Reconstruction, when Alabama's Legislature
was about one-third white and two-thirds negro, a fine
old gentleman who had been a slaveholder and was an
experienced parliamentarian, was attempting to preside
over the Legislature. In this he experienced much difficulty,
his greatest <i>b&ecirc;te noir</i> being a negro member,
full of oratory, who continually interrupted other speakers.</p>

<p>Realizing that this was a part of the new order of
things, the presiding officer tried not to allow his irritation
to get the better of him, and to silence the objectionable
man in parliamentary fashion. "The member
will kindly come to order!" he repeated over and over,
rapping with his gavel. "The member will kindly come
to order!"</p>

<p>After this had gone on for some time without effect,
the old gentleman's patience became exhausted. He
laid down his gavel, arose to his feet, glared at the irrepressible
member, and, shaking his finger savagely,
shouted: "Sit down, you blankety-blank black blankety-blank!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the negro dropped instantly to his seat
and was no more heard from.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<br />
AN ALLEGORY OF ACHIEVEMENT</h2>


<p>To visit Birmingham without seeing an iron and
steel plant would be like visiting Rome without
seeing the Forum. Consequently my companion
and I made application for permission to go through
the Tennessee Coal, Iron, &amp; Railroad Company's
plant, at Ensley, on the outskirts of the city. When
the permission was refused us we attacked from another
angle&mdash;using influence&mdash;and were refused again.
Next we called upon a high official of the company, and
(as we had, of course, done in making our previous requests
for admission to the plant) explained our errand.</p>

<p>Though this gentleman received us with the utmost
courtesy, he declared that the company desired no publicity,
and plainly indicated that he was not disposed to
let us into the plant.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what the trouble is," said my companion
to me. "This company is a part of the United
States Steel Corporation, and in the old muckraking
days it was thoroughly raked. They think that we have
come down here full of passionate feeling over the poor,
downtrodden workingman and the great, greedy octopus."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we are a writer and an artist. Lots of writers
and artists have made good livings by teaching magazine
readers that it is dishonest for a corporation, or a
corporation official, to prosper; that the way to integrity
is through insolvency; that the word 'company' is a
term of reproach, while 'corporation' is a foul epithet,
and 'trust' blasphemy."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"We must make it clear to these people," he said,
"that we have no mission. We must satisfy them that
we are not reformers&mdash;that we didn't come to dig out a
red-hot story, but to see red-hot rails rolled out."</p>

<p>Pursuing this course, we were successful. All that
any official of the company required of us was that we
be open-minded. The position of the company, when
we came to understand it, was simply that it did not wish
to facilitate the work of men who came down with pencils,
paper, and preconceived "views," deliberately to
play the great American game of "swat the corporation."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Surely there is not in the world an industry which,
for sheer pictorial magnificence, rivals the modern
manufacturing of steel. In the first place, the scale of
everything is inexpressibly stupendous. To speak of a
row of six blast furnaces, with mouths a hundred feet
above the ground, and chimneys rising perhaps another
hundred feet above these mouths, is not, perhaps, impressive,
but to look at such a row of furnaces, to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
their fodder of ore, dolomite, and coke brought in by
train loads; to see it fed to them by the "skip"; to hear
them roar continually for more; to feel the savage heat
generated within their bodies; to be told in shouts, above
the din, something of what is going on inside these
vast, voracious, savage monsters, and to see them dripping
their white-hot blood when they are picked by a
long steel bar in the hands of an atom of a man&mdash;this
is to witness an almost terrifying allegory of mankind's
achievement.</p>

<p>The gas generated by blast furnaces is used in part in
the hot-blast stoves&mdash;gigantic tanks from which hot air,
at very high pressure, is admitted to the furnaces themselves,
and is also used to develop steam for the blowing
engines and other auxiliaries. In the furnaces the
molten iron, because of its greater specific gravity, settles
to the bottom, while the slag floats to the top. The
slag, by the way, is not, as I had supposed, altogether
worthless, but is used for railroad ballast and in the
manufacture of cement.</p>

<p>The molten iron drawn from the blast furnaces runs
in glittering rivulets (which, at a distance of twenty
or thirty feet, burn the face and the eyes), into ladle cars
which are like a string of devils' soup bowls, mounted
on railroad trucks ready to be hauled away by a locomotive
and served at a banquet in hell.</p>

<p>That is not what happens to them, however. The
locomotive takes them to another part of the plant, and
their contents, still molten, is poured into the mixers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
These are gigantic caldrons as high as houses, which
stand in rows in an open-sided steel shed, and the chief
purpose of them is to keep the "soup" hot until it is
required for the converters&mdash;when it is again poured off
into ladle cars and drawn away.</p>

<p>The converters are in still another part of the
grounds. They are huge, pear-shaped retorts, resembling
in their action those teakettles which hang on
stands and are poured by being tilted. But a million
teakettles could be lost in one converter, and the boiling
water from a million teakettles, poured into a converter,
would be as one single drop of ice water let fall into a
red-hot stove.</p>

<p>In the converters the metalloids&mdash;silicon, manganese,
and carbon&mdash;are burned out of the iron under a flaming
heat which, by means of high air pressure, is brought
to a temperature of about 3400 degrees. It is the blowing
of these converters, and the occasional pouring of
them, which throws the Vesuvian glow upon the skies
of Birmingham at night. The heat they give off is beyond
description. Several hundred feet away you feel
it smiting viciously upon your face, and the concrete
flooring of the huge shed in which they stand is so hot as
to burn your feet through the soles of your shoes.</p>

<p>The most elaborate display of fireworks ever devised
by Mr. Pain would be but a poor thing compared with
the spectacle presented when a converter is poured.
The whole world glows with golden heat, and is filled
with an explosion of brilliant sparks, and as the molten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
metal passes out into the sunlight that light is by contrast
so feeble that it seems almost to cast a shadow
over the white-hot vats of iron.</p>

<p>Next come the tilting open-hearth furnaces, where the
iron is subjected to the action of lime at a very high
temperature. This removes the phosphorus and leaves
a bath of commercially pure iron which is then "teemed"
into a hundred-ton ladle, wherein it is treated in such
a way as to give it the properties required in the finished
steel. What these properties may be, depends, of
course, upon the purpose to which the steel is to be put.
Rails, for example, must, above all, resist abrasion, and
consequently have a higher carbon content than, say,
reinforcing bars for concrete work. To obtain various
qualities in steel are added carbon, ferro-manganese, or
ferro-silicon in proportions differing according to requirements.</p>

<p>In the next process steel ingots are made. I lost track
of the exact detail of this, but I remember seeing the
ingots riding about in their own steel cars, turning to
an orange color as they cooled, and I remember seeing
them pounded by a hammer that stood up in the air
like an elevated railroad station, and I know that pretty
soon they got into the blooming mill and were rolled
out into "blooms," after which they were handled by a
huge contrivance like a thumb and forefinger of steel
which&mdash;though the blooms weigh five tons apiece&mdash;picked
them up much as you might pick up a stick of red
candy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>Still orange-hot, the blooms find their way to the rolling
mill, where they go dashing back and forth upon
rollers and between rollers&mdash;the latter working in pairs
like the rollers of large wringers, squeezing the blooms,
in their successive passages, to greater length and
greater thinness, until at last they take the form of long,
red, glowing rails; after which they are sawed off, to the
accompaniment of a spray of white sparks, into rail
lengths, and run outside to cool. And I may add that,
while there is more brilliant heat to be seen in many
other departments of the plant, there is no department
in which the color is more beautiful than in the piles
of rails on the cooling beds&mdash;some of them still red as
they come from the rollers, others shading off to rose
and pink, and finally to their normal cold steel-gray.</p>

<p>Presently along comes a great electromagnet; from
somewhere in the sky it drops down and touches the
rails; when it rises bunches of them rise with it, and,
after sailing through the air, are gently deposited upon
flat cars. Here, even after the current is shut off, some
of them may try to stick to the magnet, as though fearing
to go forth into the world. If so, it gives them a little
shake, whereupon they let go, and it travels back to get
more rails and load them on the cars.</p>

<p>Iron ore, coal, and limestone, the three chief materials
used in the making of steel, are all found in the hills
in the immediate vicinity of Birmingham. I am told
that there is no other place in the world where the three
exist so close together. That is an impressive fact, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
one grows so accustomed to impressive facts, while passing
through this plant, that one ceases to be impressed,
becoming merely dazed.</p>

<p>If I were asked to mention one especially striking
item out of all that welter, I should think of many things&mdash;things
having to do with vastness, with gigantic movements
and mutations, with Niagara-like noises, with
great bursts of flame suggesting fallen fragments from
the sun itself&mdash;but above all I think that I should speak
of the apparent absence of men.</p>

<span class="caption">Gigantic movements and mutations, Niagara-like noises, great bursts of flame like fallen fragments from the sun</span>
</div>

<p>There were some four thousand men in the plant, I
believe, at the time we were there, but excepting when
a shift changed, and a great army passed out through
the gates, we never saw a crowd; indeed I hardly think
we saw a group of any size. Here and there two or
three men would be doing something&mdash;something which,
probably, we did not understand; in the window of a
locomotive cab, or that of a traveling crane, we would
see a man; we kept passing men as we went along; and
sometimes as we looked from a high perch over the interior
of one of the great sheds, we would be vaguely
conscious of men scattered about the place. But they
were very small and gray and inconspicuous dots upon
the surface of great things going on&mdash;going on, seemingly
by themselves, with a sort of mad, mechanical, majestic,
molten sweep.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At this time, when the great efficient organization
started by Bismarck is being devoted entirely to destruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>tion,
it is interesting to recall that the idea of industrial
welfare work originated in Germany during the
period of Bismarckian reorganization. So, paradoxically,
the very forces which, on one hand, were building
towards the new records for the extinction of life established
in the present war, were, upon the other hand,
developing plans for the safeguarding of life and for
making it worth living&mdash;plans which have enormously
affected the industrial existence of the civilized world.</p>

<p>The broad theory of industrial welfare work was
brought to this country by engineers, chemists, and
workmen who had resided in Germany; but, where this
work developed over there along co&ouml;perative lines, it has
remained for Great Britain and the United States to
work it out in a more individualistic way.</p>

<p>In this country welfare work has come as a logical
part of the general industrial development. The first
step in this development was the assembling of small,
weak industrial units into large, powerful, effective units&mdash;that
is to say, the formation of great corporations
and trusts. The second step was the co&ouml;rdination of
these great industrial alliances for "efficiency." The
third step was the achievement of material success.</p>

<p>When our great corporations were in their formative
period, effort was concentrated on making them successful,
but with success came thoughts of other things. It
began to be seen, for example, that whereas the old
small employer of labor came into personal contact with
his handful of workmen, and could himself supervise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
their welfare, some plan must now be devised for doing
this work in a large, corporate way.</p>

<p>Thus welfare work developed in the United States,
and it is interesting to observe, now, that many of our
great corporations are finding time and funds to expend
upon purely &aelig;sthetic improvements, and that, in
the construction of the most modern American industrial
plants, architects, landscape gardeners, and engineering
men work in co&ouml;peration, so that, instead of being
lopsided, the developments are harmonious and
oftentimes beautiful.</p>

<p>On work calculated to prevent accidents in mines, not
only the Tennessee Coal, Iron, &amp; Railroad Company,
but all the leading mining companies in the State join
for conference. As a result the number of accidents
steadily decreases. Nine years ago one man was killed,
on an average, for every 100,000 tons of iron ore raised.
The record at the time of our visit was one man to 450,000
tons. In the coal mines, where nine years ago one
man was killed for every 75,000 tons raised, the recent
record is one man for 650,000 tons.</p>

<p>In 1914, 126 men were killed in the coal mines of Alabama.
In 1915, though the tonnage was about the
same, this number was reduced to 63, which was a
record. All this is the result of safety work.</p>

<p>"Aside from humane considerations," said an official
of the Tennessee Company, "this concern realizes that
the man is the most valuable machine it has."</p>

<p>This gentleman was one of the ablest men we met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
in the South. While taking us through the company's
plant, and explaining to us the various operations, he
was interesting, but the real enthusiasm of the man did
not crop out until he took us to the company's villages
and showed us what was being done for the benefit of
operatives and their families, and, of course, for the
benefit of the company as well&mdash;for he was a corporation
official of the modern school, and he knew that by
benefiting its men a corporation necessarily benefits itself.</p>

<p>The story of the Tennessee Company's work among
its employees, which began about five years ago, some
time after the company was taken over by the United
States Steel Corporation, is too great to be more than
touched on here. In the department of health thirty-six
doctors, sixteen nurses, and a squad of sanitary inspectors
are employed. The department of social science
covers education, welfare, and horticulture. To
me the work of these departments was a revelation.
Each camp has a first-rate hospital, each has its schools
and guildhall, and everything is run as only an efficiently
managed corporation can run things.</p>

<p>The Docena Village is less like one's idea of a coal
"camp" than of a pretty suburban development, or a
military post, with officers' houses built around a parade.
The grounds are well kept; there is a tennis
court with vine-clad trellises about it, a fine playground
for children, pretty brick walks, with splendid trees to
shade them; and there is a brick schoolhouse which is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
better building, better equipped, better lighted, and,
above all, better ventilated than the schools I attended in
my boyhood.</p>

<p>Near the school is the guildhall, which is used for religious
services, meetings, and entertainments. And
best of all, perhaps, the houses are not the rows
of sad, unpainted cabins one remembers having seen
in western mining camps, but are pretty cottages,
touched with a slight architectural variety, and with
little variations of color, so that each home has individuality.</p>

<p>The schools are financed partly by the company and
partly by the parents of the three thousand scholars.
The teachers are, for the most part, graduates of leading
colleges&mdash;Smith, Wellesley, Vassar, the University
of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin&mdash;and educational
work of great variety is carried on, including
instruction in English for foreign employees, and domestic-science
classes for women&mdash;separate establishments,
of course, for whites and blacks, for the color line is
drawn in southern mining camps as elsewhere. Negroes
are, however, better provided for by the corporation
than by most southern municipalities, both in the
way of living conditions and of education.</p>

<p>On the whole, I believe that a child who grows up in
the Docena Village, and is educated there, has actually
a better chance than one who grows up in most Alabama
towns, or, for the matter of that, in towns in
any other State which has not compulsory education.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Moreover, I doubt that there is in all Alabama another
kindergarten as truly charming as the one we visited at
Docena, or that there is, in the State, a schoolhouse of
the same size which is as perfect as the one we saw in
that camp.</p>

<p>In another camp old houses have been remodeled, giving
practical demonstration of what can be done in the
way of making a hovel into a pretty home by the intelligent
use of a little lattice-work, a little paint, and a
few vines and flowers. Old boarding-houses in this
neighborhood have been converted into community
houses, with entertainment halls, shower baths, and
other conveniences for the men and their families.
Thus tests are being made to discover whether it is possible
to encourage among certain classes of foreign laborers,
whose habits of life have not, to put it mildly,
been of the tidiest, some appreciation of the standard
of civilization represented by clean, pretty cottages,
pleasant meeting houses, and shower baths.</p>

<p>I have not told about the billiard tables, bowling alleys,
and game rooms of the clubs, nor about the model
rooms fitted up to show housewives how they may make
their homes attractive at but slight expense, nor about
the annual medical examination of the children, nor
about the company dentists who charge their patients
only for the cost of gold actually used, nor about the
fine company store at Edgewater Mine, nor about the
excellent meats supplied by the company butchers, nor
about the low prices of supplies, nor about the effort to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
discourage employees from buying cheap furniture at
high prices on the installment plan, nor, above all, about
the clean, decent, happy look of the families we chanced
to see.</p>

<p>Even had I the space in which to tell of these things,
it is perhaps wiser that I refrain from doing so. For
I am aware that in speaking anything but ill of a great
corporation I have scandalously outraged precedent.
Nor does it argue well for my powers of observation,
or those of my companion. I feel confident that where
our limited visions perceived only prosperity and contentment,
certain of my brother writers, and his brother
illustrators would, in our places, have rent the thin, vaporish
veil of apparent corporate kindliness, and found
such foul shame, such hideous malignity, such grasping,
grubby greed, such despicable soul-destroying despotism,
as to shock the simple nature of a chief of the old-time
Russian Secret Police.</p>

<p>It shames me to think what my friend Lincoln Steffens
could have done had he but enjoyed my opportunities.
It shames me to think what John Reed or other
gifted writers for "The Masses" could have done.
And I should think that Wallace Morgan would
writhe with shame. For, where Art Young would have
seen heavy-jowled, pig-eyed Capital, in a silk hat and
a checked suit, whirling a cruel knout over the broad
and noble (but bent and shuddering) back of Labor&mdash;where
Boardman Robinson would have found a mother,

brood&mdash;what has Wallace Morgan seen?</p>

THE ROAD TO ARCADY</h2>


<p>Before we saw the train which was to take us
from Birmingham to Columbus, Mississippi, we
began to sense its quality. When we attempted
to purchase parlor car seats of the ticket agent at the
Union Station and were informed by him that our train
carried no parlor car, it seemed to us that his manner
was touched with cynicism, and this impression was confirmed
by his reply to our further timid inquiry as to a
dining car:</p>

<p>"Where do you gentlemen reckon you're a-goin' to,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>Presently we passed through the gate and better
understood the nature of the ticket agent's thoughts.
The train consisted of several untidy day coaches, the
first a Jim Crow car, the others for white people.
The negro car was already so full that many of its occupants
had to stand in the aisle, but this did not seem
to trouble them, for all were gabbling happily, and the
impression one got, in glancing through the door, was
of many sets of handsome white teeth displayed in as
many dark grinning faces. There are innumerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
things for which we cannot envy the negro, but neither
his teeth nor his good nature are among them.</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon, and the two or three other
cars, though not overcrowded, were well filled with
people from the neighboring mining towns who were
going home after having spent the morning shopping in
the city. Almost all our fellow passengers carried
packages, many had infants with them, and we were
struck with the fact that the complexions of these people
suggested a diet of pie&mdash;fried pie, if there be
such a thing&mdash;that a peculiarly high percentage of
them suffered from diseases of the eye, and that the pervading
smell of the car in which we sat was of oranges,
bananas, babies, and overheated adults.</p>

<p>A young mother in the seat in front of us had with
her three small children, the youngest an infant in arms.
She was feeding a banana to the second child, who
looked about two years old. Behind us a clean, capable-looking
woman talked in a broad Scottish dialect with
another housewife whose jargon was that of the mountaineers.</p>

<p>The region through which the train presently began
to wind its way was green and hilly, and there were
many stops at villages, all of them mining camps apparently,
made up of shabby little cabins scattered helter-skelter
upon the hillsides. In many of the cabin
doorways mothers lingered with their broods watching
the train, and on all the station platforms stood crowds
of idlers&mdash;men, women, and children, negro and white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>&mdash;many
of the men stamped, by their coal-begrimed
faces, their stained overalls, and the lamps above the
visors of their caps, as mine workers.</p>

<p>After a time my companion and I moved to the exceedingly
dirty smoking room at the end of the car,
where we sat and listened to the homely conversation
of a group of men who seemed not only to know one another,
but to know the same people in towns along the
line. Between stations they gossiped, smoked, chewed,
spat, and swore together like so many New England
crossroad sages, but when the train stopped they gave
encouraging attention to the droll performances of one
of their number, a shaggy, unshaven, rawboned man, of
middle age, gray-haired and collarless, who sat near the
window and uttered convincing imitations of the sounds
made by chickens, roosters, pigs, goats, and crows.</p>

<span class="caption">A shaggy, unshaven, rawboned man, gray-haired and collarless, sat near the window and uttered convincing imitations

</div>

<p>The platform crowds, the negroes in particular, were
mystified and lured by this animal chorus coming from
a passenger coach. On hearing it they would first gaze
in astonishment at the car, then edge up to the windows
and doors, and peer in with eyes solemn, round, and
wondering, only to be more amazed than ever by the
discovery that the car housed neither bird nor beast.
This bucolic comedy was repeated at every station until
we reached Wyatt, Alabama, where our gifted fellow
traveler arose, pointed his collar button toward the door,
bade us farewell, and departed, saying that he was going
to "walk over to Democrat."</p>

<p>Presently the conductor dropped in for a chat, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
course of which he informed the assembly that a certain
old lady in one of the towns along the way had died
the night before, whereupon our companions of the
smoking room, all of whom seemed to have known the
old lady well, held a protracted discussion of her history
and traits.</p>

<p>After a time my companion and I put in a few questions
about the State of Mississippi. Boiled down, the
principal information we gathered was as follows:</p>

<p>By the 1910 census Mississippi had not one city of
25,000 inhabitants. Meridian, with 23,000, was (and
probably still is) her metropolis, with Jackson and
Vicksburg, cities of about 20,000 each, following. The
entire State has but fifteen cities having a population of
5000 or more, so that, of a total of about a million and
three-quarters of people in the State (more than half of
them colored), only about one-tenth live in towns with a
population of 5000 or over.</p>

<p>After a little visit the conductor went away. Now
and then a man would leave us and get off at a station,
or some new passenger would join our group. Presently
I found myself thinking about dinner, and asked a
man wearing an electric-blue cap if he knew what provision
was made for the evening meal.</p>

<p>Before he could reply the train boy, who had come
into the smoking room a few minutes before, piped up.
He was a train boy of a type I had supposed extinct: the
kind of train boy one might have encountered on almost
any second-rate train twenty years ago,&mdash;a bold, im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>pudent
young smartaleck, full of insistent salesmanship
and obnoxious conversation. He declared that dinner
was not to be had, and that the only sustenance available
en route consisted in the uninviting assortment of fruit,
nuts, candy, and sweet tepid beverages contained in his
basket.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, the man we had addressed knew
better.</p>

<p>"What do you want to lie like that for, boy?" he demanded.
"You know as well as I do that the brakeman
takes on five boxes of lunch at Covin."</p>

<p>"Well," said the boy, with a grin, "I gotta sell
things, ain't I? The brakeman hadn't oughta have
that graft anyhow. <i>I'd</i> oughta have it. He gets
them lunches fer two bits and sells 'em for thirty-five
cents." Far from feeling abashed, he was pleased with
himself.</p>

<p>"Folks is funny people," remarked a man with a
weather-beaten face who sat in the corner seat, and
seemed to be addressing no one in particular. "I know
a boy that's going to git hung some day. And when
they've got the noose rigged nice around his neck, and
everything ready, and the trap a-waitin' to be sprung,
why, then that boy is goin' to be so sorry for hisself that
he won't hardly know what to do. He'll say: 'I ain't
never had no chance in life, I ain't. The world ain't
never used me right.' ... Yes, folks is funny people."</p>

<p>After this soliloquy there occurred a brief silence in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
the smoking room, and presently the train boy took up
his basket and went upon his way.</p>

<p>"You say they take on the lunches at Covin now?"
one of the passengers asked of the man in the electric-blue
cap.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's become of old man Whitney, over to Fayetteville?"</p>

<p>"They used to git lunches off of him," replied the
other, "but the old man wasn't none too dependable.
Now and then he'd oversleep, and folks on the 5 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span>
out of Columbus was like to starve for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Right smart shock-headed boy the old man's got,"
put in another. "The old man gives 'im anything he
wants. He wanted a motorcycle, and the old man give
'im one. Then he wanted one of them hot-candy machines;
they cost about two hundred and fifty dollars,
but the old man give it to 'im just the same."</p>

<p>"The kid went to San Francisco with it, didn't he?"
asked the man with the electric-blue cap.</p>

<p>"He started to go there," replied the former speaker,
"but he only got as fur as Little Rock; then he come on
back home, and the old man bought 'im a wireless-telegraph
plant. Yeaup! That boy gets messages right
outa the air&mdash;from Washington, D.&nbsp;C., and Berlin, and
every place. The Govamunt don't allow 'im to tell you
much of it. He tells a little, though&mdash;just to give you a
notion."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>So, through the five-hour ride the conversation ran.
Several times the talk drifted to politics and to the European
War, but the politics discussed were local and lopsided,
and the war was all too clearly regarded as something
interesting but vague and remote. On the entire
journey not one word was spoken indicating that the
people of this section had the least grasp on any national
question, or that they were considering national questions,
or that they realized what the war in Europe is
about&mdash;that it is a war for freedom and democracy, a
war against war, a war to prevent a few individuals
from ever again plunging the world into war. Nor,
though the day of our entry into the war was close at
hand, had the idea that we might be forced to take part
in the conflict so much as occurred to any of them.</p>

<p>They were not stupid people; on the contrary, some
of them possessed a homely and picturesque philosophy;
but they were not informed, and the reason they
were not informed has to do with one of the chief needs
of our rural population&mdash;especially the rural population
of the South.</p>

<p>What they need is good newspapers. They need
more world news and national news in place of county
news and local briefs. In the whole South, moreover,
there is need for general political news instead of biased
news written always from inside the Democratic party,
and sandwiched in between patent medicine advertisements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI<br />
<br />
A MISSISSIPPI TOWN</h2>


<p>It was dark when, after a journey of one hundred
and twenty miles at the rate of twenty miles an
hour, we reached Columbus, a city which was never
intended to be a metropolis and which will never be one.</p>

<p>Columbus is situated upon a bluff on the east bank of
the Tombigbee River, to the west of which is a very fertile
lowland region, filled with plantations, the owners
of which, a century ago, founded the town in order that
their families might have churches, schools, and the advantages
of social life. As the town grew, a curious but
entirely natural community spirit developed; when a gas
plant, water works, or hotel was needed, prosperous citizens
got together and financed the enterprise, not so
much for profit as for mutual comfort.</p>

<p>In these ante bellum times the planters used to make
annual journeys to Mobile and New Orleans, going by
boat on the Tombigbee and taking their crops and their
families with them. After selling their cotton and enjoying
themselves in the city, they would load supplies
for the ensuing year upon river boats and return to Columbus,
where the supplies were transferred to their
vast attic storerooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>Though their only water transportation was to the
southward, they did not journey invariably in that direction,
but sometimes made excursions to such fashionable
watering places as the Virginia Springs, or Saratoga,
to which they drove in their own carriages.</p>

<p>When, in the early days of railroad building, the Mobile
&amp; Ohio Railroad was being planned, the company
proposed to include Columbus as one of its main-line
points and asked for a right of way through the town
and a cash bonus in consideration of the benefits Columbus
would derive from railroad service. Both requests
were refused. The railroad company then waived the
bonus and attempted to obtain a right of way by purchase.
But to no purpose. The citizens would not sell.
They did not want a railroad. They were prosperous
and healthy, and they contended that a railroad would
bring poor people and disease among them, besides killing
farm animals and causing runaways. The company
was consequently forced to make a new survey,
and when the line was built it passed at a distance of a
dozen miles or more from the city.</p>

<p>Gradually dawned the era of speed and impatience.
People who had hitherto been satisfied to make long
journeys in horse-drawn vehicles, and had refused the
railroad a right of way, now began to complain of the
twelve-mile drive to the nearest station, and to suggest
that the company build a branch line into the town.
But this time it was the railroad's turn to say no, and
Columbus was informed that if it wished a branch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
line it could go ahead and build it at its own expense.
This was finally done at a cost of fifty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>With the construction of the branch line, carriages
fell into disuse and dilapidation, and many an old
barouche, landau, and brett passed into the hands of
the negro hackmen who were former slaves of the old
families. Among these ex-slaves the traditions of the
first families of Columbus were upheld long after the
war, and it thus happened that when, a few years since,
a young New Yorker, arriving for a visit in the town,
alighted from his train, he was greeted by an ancient
negro who, indicating an equally ancient carriage, cried:
"Hack, suh! Hack, suh! Ain't nevah been rid in by
none but the Billupses."</p>

<p>Not every young man from the North would have
understood this reference, but by a coincidence it was at
the residence of Mrs. Billups that this one had come
to visit.</p>

<p>Neither as to hack nor habitation were my companion
and I so fortunate as the earlier visitor. Our conveyance
was a Ford, and the driver warned us, as we progressed
through shadowy tree-bordered streets, that the
Gilmer Hotel was crowded with delegates who had come
to attend the State convention of the Order of the Eastern
Star. Nor was his warning without foundation.
The wide old-fashioned lobby of the Gilmer was hung
with the colors of the Order and packed with Ladies
of the Eastern Star and their ecstatic families; we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
managed to make our way through the press only to be
told by the single worn-out clerk on duty that not a room
was to be had.</p>

<p>Unlike the haughty clerk who had dismissed us from
the Tutwiler Hotel in Birmingham, the clerk at the
Gilmer was not without the quality of mercy. Overworked
though he was, he began at once to telephone
about the town in an effort to secure us rooms. But if
this led us to conclude that our problem was thereby in
effect solved, we discovered, after listening to his brief
telephonic conversations with a series of unseen ladies,
that the conclusion was premature. Though there
were vacant rooms in several private houses, strange
stray males were not desired as lodgers.</p>

<p>Concerned as we were over our plight, my companion
and I could not help being aware that a young lady who
had been standing at the desk when we came in, and
had since remained there, was taking kindly interest in
the situation. Nor, for the matter of that, could we
help being aware, also, that she was very pretty in her
soft black dress and corsage of narcissus. She did not
speak to us; indeed, she hardly honored us with a glance;
but, despite her sweet circumspection, we sensed in some
subtle way that she was sorry for us, and were cheered
thereby.</p>

<p>After a time, when the clerk seemed to have reached
the end of his resources, the young lady hesitantly ventured
some suggestions as to other houses where rooms
might possibly be had. These suggestions she ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>dressed
entirely to the clerk&mdash;who, upon receiving them,
did more telephoning.</p>

<p>"Have you tried Mrs. Eichelberger?" the young lady
asked him, after several more failures.</p>

<p>He had not, but promptly did so. His conversation
with Mrs. Eichelberger started promisingly, but presently
we heard him make the damning admission he had
been compelled repeatedly to make before:</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. It's two men."</p>

<p>Then, just as the last hope seemed to be fading, our
angel of mercy spoke again.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she put in impulsively. "Tell her&mdash;tell her
I recommend them."</p>

<p>Thus informed, Mrs. Eichelberger became compliant;
but when the details were arranged, and we turned to
thank our benefactor, she had fled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eichelberger's house was but a few blocks distant
from the Gilmer. She installed us in two large,
comfortable rooms, remarking, as we entered, that we
had better hurry, as we were already late.</p>

<p>"Late for what?" one of us asked.</p>

<p>"Didn't you come for the senior dramatics?"</p>

<p>"Senior dramatics where?"</p>

<p>"At the I.&nbsp;I. and C."</p>

<p>"What is the I.&nbsp;I. and C?"</p>

<p>At this question a look of doubt, if not suspicion,
crossed the lady's face.</p>

<p>"Where are you-all from?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The statement that we came from New York seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
to explain satisfactorily our ignorance of the I.&nbsp;I. and
C. Evidently Mrs. Eichelberger expected little of New
Yorkers. The I.&nbsp;I. and C., she explained, was the
Mississippi Industrial Institute and College, formerly
known as the Female College, a State institution for
young women; and the senior dramatics were even then
in progress in the college chapel, just up the street.</p>

<p>To the chapel, therefore, my companion and I repaired
as rapidly as might be, guided thither by frequent
sounds of applause.</p>

<p>From among the seniors standing guard in cap and
gown at the chapel door, the quick artistic eye of my
companion selected a brown-eyed auburn-haired young
goddess as the one from whom tickets might most appropriately
be bought. Nor did he display thrift in the
transaction. Instead of buying modest quarter seats
he magnificently purchased the fifty-cent kind.</p>

<p>The dazzling ticket seller, transformed to usher, now
led us into the crowded auditorium and down an aisle.
A few rows from the stage she stopped, and, fastening a
frigid gaze upon two hapless young women who were
seated some distance in from the passageway, bade them
emerge and yield their place to us.</p>

<p>Of course we instantly protested, albeit in whispers,
as the play was going on. But the beautiful Olympian
lightly brushed aside our objections.</p>

<p>"They don't belong here," she declared loftily.
"They're freshmen&mdash;and they only bought quarter
seats."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as the guilty pair seemed to hesitate, she summoned
them with a compelling gesture and the command:
"Come out!"</p>

<p>At this they arose meekly enough, whereupon we redoubled
our protests. But to no purpose. The Titian-tinted
creature was relentless. Our pleas figured no
more in her scheme of things than if they had been babblings
in an unknown tongue. To add to our discomfiture,
a large part of the audience seemed to have perceived
the nature of our dilemma, and was giving us
amused attention.</p>

<p>It was a crisis; and in a crisis&mdash;especially one in which
a member of the so-called gentle sex is involved&mdash;I have
learned to look to my companion. He understands
women. He has often told me so. And now, by his
action, he proved it. What he did was to turn and flee,
and I fled with him; nor did we pause until we were
safely hidden away in humble twenty-five cent seats at
the rear of the chapel, in the shadow of the overhanging
gallery.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to write an extended criticism
of the performance. For one thing, I witnessed only a
fragment of it, and for another, though I once acted for
a brief period as dramatic critic on a New York newspaper,
I was advised by my managing editor to give up
dramatic criticism, and I have followed his advice.</p>

<p>The scene evidently represented a room, its walls
made of red screens behind which rose the lofty pipes of
the chapel organ. On a pedestal at one side stood a bust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
of the Venus de Milo, while on the other hung an engraving
of a familiar picture which I believe is called
"The Fates," and which has the appearance of having
been painted by some-one-or-other like Leighton or
Bouguereau or Harold Bell Wright.</p>

<p>After we had given some attention to the play my
companion remarked that, from the dialect, he judged
it to be "Uncle Tom's Cabin." I had been told, however,
that for certain reasons "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is
never played in the South; I therefore asked the young
man in front of me what play it was. He replied that
it was Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon Wilson's
comedy, "The Man From Home," and as he made the
statement openly, I feel that I am violating no confidence
in repeating what he said&mdash;especially since his declaration
was supported by the program which he showed me.</p>

<p>He was a pleasant young man. Perceiving that I
was a stranger, he volunteered the additional information
that the masculine r&ocirc;les, as well as the feminine
ones, were being played by girls; and I trust that I will
not seem to be boasting of perspicacity when I declare
that there had already entered my mind a suspicion that
such was indeed the case.</p>

<p>Behold them! Gaze upon the character called Daniel
Voorhees Pike! See what long strides he takes, and
with what pretty tiny feet! Observe the manliness with
which he thrusts his pink little hands deep in the pockets
of his&mdash;or somebody's&mdash;pantaloons!</p>

<span class="caption">Gaze upon the character called Daniel Voorhees Pike! Observe the manliness with which he thrusts his pink little

</div>

<p>Look at the Grand Duke Vasili of Russia, his sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
oval face and rosy mouth partly obscured by mustache
and goatee of a most strange wooliness.</p>

<p>Observe the ineradicable daintiness of the Honorable
Almeric St. Aubyn, but more particularly attend to that
villain of helpless loveliness, the Earl of Hawcastle.
The frightful life which, it is indicated, the Earl has led,
leaves no tell-tale marks upon his blooming countenance.
His only facial disfigurement consists in a mustache
which, by reason of its grand-ducal lanateness, seems
to hint at a mysterious relationship between the British
and Russian noblemen.</p>

<p>Take note, moreover, of the outlines of the players.
If ever earl was belted it was this one. If ever duke
in evening dress revealed delectable convexities of figure,
it was this duke. If ever worthy male from Indiana
spoke in a soprano voice and was lithe, alluring,
and recurvous, she was Daniel Voorhees Pike.</p>

<p>A young woman seated near us described to her escort
the personal characteristics of the various young
ladies on the stage, and when we heard her call one girl
who played in a betrousered part, "a perfect darling,"
we echoed inwardly the sentiment. All were darlings.
And this especial "perfect darling" appeared as well to
be a "perfect thirty-six."</p>

<p>The Earl was my undoing. At a critical point in
the unfolding of the plot there was talk of his having
been connected with a scandal in St. Petersburg.
This he attempted to deny, and though I am unable
to quote the exact words of his denial, the sound of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
lingers sweetly in my memory. Nor would the exact
words, could I give them, convey, in print, the quality
of what was said, for the Earl, and all the rest, spoke in
the soft, melodious tones of Mississippi.</p>

<p>"What you-all fussin' raound heah for, this mownin'?"
That, perhaps, conveys some sense of a line he
spoke on entering.</p>

<p>And when, in reply, one of the others mentioned
the scandal at St. Petersburg, the flavor of the Earl's
retort, as its cooing tones remain with me, was
this:</p>

<p>"Wha', honey! What you-all mean hintin' raound
'baout St. Petuhsbuhg? I reckon you don' know what
you talkin' 'baout! Ah nevuh was in that taown in all
ma bo'n days!"</p>

<p>What followed I am unable to relate, for the Earl's
speech caused me to become emotional, and my companion,
after informing me severely that I was making
myself conspicuous, removed me from the chapel.</p>

<p>The auburn goddess was still on duty at the door as
we went out. Advancing, she placed in each of our
hands a quarter. I regret to say that, in my shaken
state, I misinterpreted this action.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! <i>Please!</i>" I protested, fearing that she
thought we had not enjoyed the performance, and was
therefore returning our money. "It really wasn't bad
at all. We're only going because we have an engagement."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be quiet!" interrupted my companion in a savage
undertone, jerking me along by the arm. "It's only a
rebate on the seats!" And without allowing me a
chance to set myself right he dragged me out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

OLD TALES AND A NEW GAME</h2>


<p>Mrs. Eichelberger supplied us merely
with a place to sleep. For meals she referred
us to a lady who lived a few doors up the street.
But when in the morning we went, full of hunger and of
hope, to the house of this lady, we were coldly informed
that breakfast was over, and were recommended to the
Bell Caf&eacute;, downtown.</p>

<p>My companion and I are not of that robust breed
which enjoys a bracing walk before its morning coffee,
and the fact that the streets of Columbus charmed us,
as we now saw them for the first time by daylight, is
proof enough of their quality. There is but little appetite
for beauty in an empty stomach.</p>

<p>The streets were splendidly wide, and bordered with
fine old trees, and the houses, each in its own lawn, each
with its vines and shrubs, were full of the suggestion of
an easy-going home life and an informal hospitality.
Most of them were of frame and in their architecture
illustrated the decadence of the eighties and nineties,
but here or there was a fine old brick homestead with
a noble columned portico, or a formal Georgian house,
disposed among beautiful trees and gardens and shel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>tered
from the street by an ancient hedge of box. So,
though Columbus is, as I have indicated, not too easily
reached by rail, and though, as I have further indicated,
walks before breakfast are not to my taste, I am compelled
to say that for both the journey and the walk I
felt repaid by the sight of some of the old houses&mdash;the
Baldwin house, the W.&nbsp;D. Humphries house, the J.&nbsp;O.
Banks house, the old McLaren house, the Kinnebrew
house, the Thomas Hardy house, the J.&nbsp;M. Morgan
house, with its garden of lilies and roses, its giant magnolia
trees and its huge camellia bushes; and most of all,
perhaps, for its Georgian beauty, the mellow tone of its
old brick, its rich tangle of southern growths, and its
associations, the venerable mansion of the late General
Stephen D. Lee, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.&mdash;now the property of the latter's
only son, Mr. Blewett Lee, general counsel of the
Illinois Central Railroad, and a resident of Chicago.</p>

</div>

<p>It was apropos of our visit to the Lee house that I was
told of a dramatic and touching example of the rebirth
of amity between North and South.</p>

<p>Stephen D. Lee it was who, as a young artillery officer
attached to the staff of General Beauregard, transmitted
the actual order to fire on Fort Sumter, the shot
which began the war. Two years later, having been
promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, the same
Stephen D. Lee participated in the defense of Vicksburg
against the assaults of Porter's gunboats from the
river and of Grant's armies, which hemmed in the hilled
city on landward side, until at last, on the 4th of July,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
1863, the place was surrendered, making Grant's fame
secure.</p>

<p>Years after, when the Government of the United
States accepted a statue of General Stephen D. Lee, to
be placed upon the battle ground of Vicksburg&mdash;now a
national park&mdash;it was the late General Frederick Dent
Grant, son of the capturer of the city, who journeyed
thither to unveil the memorial to his father's former
foe. And by a peculiarly gracious and fitting set of circumstances
it came about that when, in April last, the
ninety-fifth anniversary of the birth of U.&nbsp;S. Grant
was celebrated in his native city, Galena, Illinois, it was
Blewett Lee, only son of the general taken by Grant at
Vicksburg, who journeyed to Galena and there in a
memorial address, returned the earlier compliment paid
to the memory of his own father by Grant's son.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Columbus may perhaps appreciate the charm of its
old homes, but there is evidence to show that it did not
appreciate certain other weatherworn structures of
great beauty. I have seen photographs of an old Baptist
Church with a fine (and not at all Baptist-looking)
portico and fluted columns, which was torn down to
make room for the present stupidly commonplace Baptist
church: and I have seen pictures of the beautiful old
town hall which was recently supplanted by an ignorantly
ordinary town building of yellow pressed brick.
The destruction of these two early buildings represents
an irreparable loss to Columbus, and it is to be hoped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
that the town will some day be sufficiently enlightened
to know that this is true and to regret that it did
not restore and enlarge them instead of tearing them
down.</p>

<p>Until a decade or two ago Columbus had, so far as I
can learn, but four streets possessing names: Main
Street, Market Street, College Street, and Catfish Alley,
all other streets being known as "the street that Mrs.
Billups, or Mrs. Sykes, or Mrs. Humphries, or Mrs.
Some-one-else lives on."</p>

<p>Market and Main are business streets&mdash;at least they
are so where they cross&mdash;and, like the other streets, are
wide. They are lined with brick buildings few if any of
them more than three stories in height, and it was in
one of these buildings, on Main Street, that we found the
Bell Caf&eacute;&mdash;advertised as "the most exclusive caf&eacute; in
the State."</p>

<p>Being in search of breakfast rather than exclusiveness,
we did not sit at one of the tables, but at the long
lunch counter, where we were quickly served.</p>

<p>After breakfast we felt strong enough to look at picture
post cards, and to that end visited first "Cheap
Joe's" and then the shop of Mr. Divilbis, where newspapers,
magazines, sporting goods, cameras, and all
such things, are sold. Having viewed post cards picturing
such scenes as "Main Street looking north,"
"The 1st Baptist Church," and "Steamer <i>America</i>,
Tombigbee River," we were about to depart, when our
attention was drawn to a telephonic conversation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
had started between Mr. Divilbis's clerk and a customer
who was thinking of going in for the game of lawn
tennis. The half of the conversation which was audible
to us proved entertaining, and we dallied, eavesdropping.</p>

<p>The clerk began by recommending tennis. "Yes," he
said, "that would be very nice. Everybody is playing
tennis now."</p>

<p>But that got him into trouble, for after a pause he
said: "I'm sorry I can't tell you everything about it.
I don't play tennis myself. Al could tell you, though.
He plays."</p>

<p>Then, after a much longer pause: "Well, ma'am,
you see, in a game of lawn tennis everybody owns their
own racquet."</p>

<p>At this juncture a tall, thin man in what is known
(excepting at Palm Beach) as a "Palm Beach suit,"
entered the shop and the clerk asked his inquisitor to
hold the wire while he made some inquiries. After a
long conversation with the new arrival he returned to
the telephone and resumed his explanation.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, they have a net, and one stands on one
side and one on the other&mdash;yes, ma'am, there <i>can</i> be two
on each side&mdash;and one serves. What? Yes, he hits
the ball over the net, and it has to go in the opposite
court on the other side, and then if that one doesn't
send it back&mdash;Yes, the court is marked with lines&mdash;why,
that counts fifteen. The next count is thirty.
What? No, ma'am, I don't know why they count that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
way. No, it's just the way they do in lawn tennis. If
your opponent has nothing, why, they call that 'love.'
Yes, that's it&mdash;l-o-v-e&mdash;just the same as when anybody's
<i>in</i> love. No, ma'am, I don't know why....
So that's the way they count.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, the lines are boundaries. You have to
stand in a certain place and hit the ball in a certain
place.... No, I don't mean that way. You've got to
hit it so it <i>lands</i> in a certain place; and the one that's
playing against you has to hit it back in a certain place,
and if it goes in some <i>other</i> place, then you can't play it
any more. Oh, no! Not all day. I mean that ends
<i>that</i> part, and you start over. You just keep on doing
like that."</p>

<p>But though it was apparent that he considered his
explanation complete, the lady at the other end of the
wire was evidently not yet satisfied, and as he began to
struggle with more questions we left the shop and went
to the Gilmer Hotel to see if any mail had come for us.</p>

<p>The Gilmer was built by slave labor some years before
the war, and was in its day considered a very
handsome edifice. Nor is it to-day an unsatisfactory
hotel for a town of the size of Columbus. Its old brick
walls are sturdy, and its rooms are of a fine spaciousness.
Downstairs it has been somewhat remodeled,
but the large parlor on the second floor is much as it was
in the beginning, even to the great mirrors and the
carved furniture imported more than sixty years ago
from France. Most of the doors still have the old locks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
and the window cords originally installed were of such
a quality that they have not had to be renewed.</p>

<p>The Gilmer was still new when the Battle of Shiloh
was fought, and several thousand of the wounded were
brought to Columbus. The hotel and various other
buildings, including that of the former Female Institute,
were converted into hospitals, as were also many
private houses in the town.</p>

<p>Though there was never fighting at Columbus, the
end of the war found some fifteen hundred soldiers'
graves in Friendship Cemetery, perhaps twoscore of the
number being those of Federals. The citizens were, at
this time, too poor and too broken in spirit to erect
memorials, but several ladies of Columbus made it their
custom to visit the cemetery and care for the graves of
the Confederate dead. This movement, started by individuals&mdash;Miss
Matt Moreton, Mrs. J.&nbsp;T. Fontaine, and
Mrs. Green T. Hill&mdash;was soon taken up by other ladies
of the place and resulted in a determination to make the
decoration of soldiers' graves an annual occurrence.</p>

<p>In an old copy of the "Mississippi Index," published
at the time, may be found an account of the solemn march
of the women, young and old, to the cemetery, on April
25, 1866&mdash;one year after Robert E. Lee's surrender&mdash;and
of the decoration of the graves not only of Confederate
but of Federal soldiers. It is the proud boast
of Columbus that this occasion constituted the first celebration
of the now national Decoration Day&mdash;or, as it is
more properly called, Memorial Day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>It should perhaps be said here that Columbus, Georgia,
disputes the claim of Columbus, Mississippi, as to
Memorial Day. In the Georgia city it is contended that
the idea of decorating soldiers' graves originated with
Miss Lizzie Rutherford, later Mrs. Roswell Ellis, of
that place. The inscription of Mrs. Ellis' monument in
Linwood Cemetery, Columbus, Georgia, states that the
idea of Memorial Day originated with her.</p>

<p>It seems clear, however, that the same idea occurred
to women in both cities simultaneously, and that, while
the actual celebration of the day occurred in Columbus,
Mississippi, one day earlier than in Columbus, Georgia,
the ladies of the latter city may have been first in suggesting
that Memorial Day be not a local celebration,
but one in which the whole South should take part.</p>

<p>The incident of the first decoration of the graves of
Union as well as Confederate soldiers appears, however,
to belong entirely to Columbus, Mississippi, and it is certain
that this exhibition of magnanimity inspired F.&nbsp;W.
Finch to write the famous poem, "The Blue and the
Gray," for when that poem was first published in the
"Atlantic Monthly" for September, 1867, it carried the
following headnote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The women of Columbus, Miss., animated by noble sentiments,
have shown themselves impartial in their offerings to the memory
of the dead. They strewed flowers on the graves of the
Confederate and of the National soldiers.</p></div>

<p>This episode becomes the more touching by reason
of the fact that the Columbus lady who initiated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
movement to place flowers on the Union graves, at a
time when such action was sure to provoke much criticism
in the South, was Mrs. Augusta Murdock Sykes,
herself the widow of a Confederate soldier.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

OUT OF THE LONG AGO</h2>


<p>While local historians attempt to tangle up
the exploration of De Soto with the early
history of this region, saying that De Soto
"entered the State of Mississippi near the site of Columbus,"
and that "he probably crossed the Tombigbee
River at this point," their conclusions are largely the
result of guesswork. But it is not guesswork to say that
when the Kentucky and Tennessee volunteers, going to
the aid of Andrew Jackson, at New Orleans, in 1814, cut
a military road from Tuscumbia, Alabama, to the Gulf,
they passed over the site of Columbus, for the road they
cut remains to-day one of the principal highways of the
district as well as one of the chief streets of the town.</p>

<p>More clearly defined, of course, are memories of the
Civil War and of Reconstruction, for there are many
present-day residents of Columbus who remember both.
Among these is one of those wonderful, sweet, high-spirited,
and altogether fascinating ladies whom we
call old only because their hair is white and because a
number of years have passed over their heads&mdash;one of
those glorious young old ladies in which the South is, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
think, richer than any other single section of the world.</p>

<p>It was our good fortune to meet Mrs. John Billups,
and to see some of her treasured relics&mdash;among them the
flag carried through the battles of Monterey and Buena
Vista by the First Mississippi Regiment, of which Jefferson
Davis was colonel, and in which her husband was
a lieutenant; and a crutch used by General Nathan Bedford
Forrest when he was housed at the Billups residence
in Columbus, recovering from a wound. But better
yet it was to hear Mrs. Billups herself tell of the
times when the house in which she lived as a young
woman, at Holly Springs, Mississippi, was used as
headquarters by General Grant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Billups, who was a Miss Govan, was educated in
Philadelphia and Wilmington, and had many friends
and relatives in the North. Her mother was Mrs.
Mary Govan of Holly Springs, and her brother's wife,
who resided with the Govans during the war, was a Miss
Hawkes, a daughter of the Rev. Francis L. Hawkes,
then rector of St. Thomas's Church in New York. All
were, however, good Confederates.</p>

<p>Mrs. Govan's house at Holly Springs was being used
as a hospital when Grant and his army marched, unresisted,
into the town, and Mrs. Govan, with her daughters
and daughter-in-law, had already moved to the residence
of Colonel Harvey Walter, which is to this day
a show place, and is now the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Oscar Johnson of St. Louis&mdash;Mrs. Johnson being Colonel
Walter's daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>This house was selected by Grant as his headquarters,
and he resided there for a considerable period. ("It
seemed a mighty long time," says Mrs. Billups.) With
the general was Mrs. Grant and their son Jesse, as
well as Mrs. Grant's negro maid, Julia, who, Mrs.
Grant told Mrs. Billups, had been given to her, as a
slave, by her father, Colonel Dent. Mrs. Billups was
under the impression that Julia was, at that time, still a
slave. At all events, she was treated as a slave.</p>

<p>"We all liked the Grants," Mrs. Billups said. "He
had very little to say, but she was very sociable and used
to come in and sit with us a great deal.</p>

<p>"One day the general took his family and part of his
army and went to Oxford, Mississippi, leaving Colonel
Murphy in command at Holly Springs. While Grant
was away our Confederate General Van Dorn made a
raid on Holly Springs, capturing the town, tearing up
the railroad, and destroying the supplies of the Northern
army. He just dashed in, did his work, and dashed
out again.</p>

<p>"Some of his men came to the house and, knowing that
it was Grant's headquarters, wished to make a search.
My mother was entirely willing they should do so, but
she knew that there were no papers in the house, and
assured the soldiers that if they did search they would
find nothing but Mrs. Grant's personal apparel&mdash;which
she was sure they would not wish to disturb.</p>

<p>"That satisfied them and they went away.</p>

<p>"Next morning back came Grant with his army. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
rode up on horseback, preceded by his bodyguard, and I
remember that he looked worn and worried.</p>

<p>"As he dismounted he saw my sister-in-law, Mrs.
Eaton Pugh Govan&mdash;the one who was Miss Hawkes&mdash;standing
on the gallery above.</p>

<p>"He called up to her and said: 'Mrs. Govan, I suppose
my sword is gone?'</p>

<p>"'What sword, General?' she asked him.</p>

<p>"'The sword that was presented to me by the army.
I left it in my wife's closet.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Govan was thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"'I didn't know it was there,' she said. 'Oh! I should
have been tempted to send it to General Van Dorn if I
had known that it was there!'</p>

<p>"The next morning, as a reward to us for not having
known that his sword was there, the general gave us a
protection paper explicitly forbidding soldiers to enter
the house."</p>

<p>Of course the Govans, like all other citizens of invaded
districts in the South, buried their family plate before
the "Yankees" came.</p>

<p>Shortly after this had been accomplished&mdash;as they
thought, secretly&mdash;the Govans were preparing to entertain
friends at dinner when a negro boy who helped
about the dining-room remarked innocently, in the presence
of Mrs. Govan and several of her servants:</p>

<p>"Missus ain't gwine to have no fine table to-night,
caze all de silvuh's done buried in de strawbe'y patch."</p>

<p>He had seen the old gardener "planting" the plate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereafter it was quietly decided in the family that
the negroes had better know nothing about the location
of buried treasure. That night, therefore, some gentlemen
went out to the strawberry patch, disinterred the
silver, carried it to Colonel Walter's place, and there
buried it under the front walk.</p>

<p>"And after Grant came," said Mrs. Billups, "we used
to laugh as we watched the Union sentries marching up
and down that walk, right over our plate."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Among the items not already mentioned, of which
Columbus is proud, are the facts that she has supplied
two cabinet members within the past decade&mdash;J.&nbsp;M.
Dickinson, Taft's Secretary of War, and T.&nbsp;W. Gregory,
Wilson's Attorney General&mdash;and that J. Gano Johnson,
breeder of famous American saddle horses, has recently
come from Kentucky and established his Emerald Chief
Stock Farm in Lowndes County, a short distance from
the town.</p>

<p>But items like these, let me be frank to say, do not
appeal to me as do the picturesque old stories which
cling about such a town.</p>

<p>There is, for instance, the story of Alexander Keith
McClung, famous about the middle of the last century as
a duellist and dandy. McClung was a Virginian by
birth, but while still a young man took up his residence
in Columbus. His father studied law under Thomas
Jefferson and was later conspicuous in Kentucky politics,
and his mother was a sister of Chief Justice John Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>shall.
In 1828, at the age of seventeen, McClung became
a midshipman in the navy, and though he remained
in the service but a year, he managed during that time
to fight a duel with another midshipman, who wounded
him in the arm. At eighteen he fought a duel near
Frankfort, Kentucky, with his cousin James W. Marshall.
His third duel was with a lawyer named Allen,
who resided in Jackson, Mississippi. Allen was the
challenger&mdash;as it is said McClung took pains to see that
his adversaries usually were, so that he might have the
choice of weapons, for he was very skillful with the pistol.
In his duel with Allen he specified that each was
to be armed with four pistols and a bowie knife, that
they were to start eighty paces apart, and upon signal
were to advance, firing at will. At about thirty paces
he shot Allen through the brain. His fourth duel was
with John Menifee, of Vicksburg, and was fought in
1839, on the river bank, near that city, with rifles at
thirty yards. Some idea of the spirit in which duelling
was taken in those days may be gathered from
the fact that the Vicksburg Rifles, of which Menifee was
an officer, turned out in full uniform to see the fight.
However they were doubly disappointed, for it was Menifee
and not McClung who died. It is said that a short
time after this, one of Menifee's brothers challenged McClung,
who killed this brother, and so on until he had
killed all seven male members of the Menifee family.</p>

<p>McClung fought gallantly in the Mexican War, as
lieutenant-colonel of the First Mississippi Regiment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
of which Jefferson Davis was colonel. Though he remained
always a bachelor it is said that he had many
love affairs. He was a hard drinker, a flowery speaker,
and a writer of sentimental verse. It is said that in his
later life he was exceedingly unhappy, brooding over the
lives he had taken in duels&mdash;fourteen in all. His last
poem was an "Invocation to Death," ending with the
line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, Death, come soon! Come soon!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shortly after writing it he shaved, dressed himself
with the most scrupulous care, and shot himself. This
occurred March 23, 1855, in the Eagle Hotel, North Capitol
Street, Jackson, Mississippi.</p>

<p>"To preserve the neatness and cleanliness of his attire
after death should have ensued," says Colonel R.&nbsp;W.
Banks, "it is said he poured a little water upon the floor
to ascertain the direction the blood would take when it
flowed from the wound. Then, placing himself in
proper position, so that the gore would run from and not
toward his body, he placed the pistol to the right temple,
pulled the trigger and death quickly followed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<br />
THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND HIM</h2>


<p>On our second evening in Columbus my companion
and I returned to the house, near our
domicile, to which we had been sent by Mrs.
Eichelberger for our meals; but owing to a misunderstanding
as to the dinner hour we found ourselves
again too late. The family, and the teachers
from the I.&nbsp;I. and C. who took meals there, were already
coming out from dinner to sit and chat on the steps in
the twilight.</p>

<p>We were disappointed, for we were tired of restaurants,
and had counted on a home meal that night; nor
was our disappointment softened by the fact that the
lady whom we interviewed seemed to have no pity for us,
but dismissed us in a chilling manner, which hinted that,
even had we been in time for dinner, we should have
been none too welcome at her exclusive board.</p>

<p>Crestfallen, we turned away and started once more
in the direction of the Belle Caf&eacute;. In the half light the
street held for us a melancholy loveliness. Above, the
great trees made a dark, soft canopy; the air was balmy
and sweet with the scent of lilacs and roses; lights were
beginning to appear in windows along the way. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
none of it was for us. We were wanderers, condemned
forever to walk through strange streets whose homes
we might not enter, and whose inhabitants we might not
know.</p>

<p>When we had proceeded in silence for a block or two,
we perceived a woman strolling toward us on the walk
ahead. Nor was it yet so dark that we could fail to
notice, as we neared her, that she was very pretty in her
soft black dress and her corsage of narcissus&mdash;that, in
short, she was the young lady whom, though we were indebted
to her for our rooms at Mrs. Eichelberger's, we
had not been able to thank.</p>

<p>Now, of course, we stopped and told her of our gratitude.
First my companion told her of his. Then I told
her of mine. Then we both told her of our combined
gratitude. And after each telling she assured us sweetly
that it was nothing&mdash;nothing at all.</p>

<p>All this made quite a little conversation. She hoped
that we were comfortable. We assured her that we
were. Then, because it seemed so pleasant to be talking,
on a balmy, flower-scented evening, with a pretty
girl wearing a soft black dress and a corsage of narcissus,
we branched out, telling her of our successive
disappointments as to meals in the house up the street.</p>

<p>"Which house?" she asked.</p>

<p>We described it.</p>

<p>"That's where I live," said she.</p>

<p>And to think we had twice been late!</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> live there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. It was my elder sister whom you saw." Then
we all smiled, for we had spoken of the chill which had
accompanied the rebuff.</p>

<p>"Do you think your sister will let us come to-morrow
for breakfast?" ventured my companion.</p>

<p>"If you're there by eight."</p>

<p>"Because," he added, "breakfast is our last meal
here."</p>

<p>"You're going away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. About noon."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said. And we hoped the way she said it
meant that she was just the least bit sorry we were
going.</p>

<p>With that she started to move on again.</p>

<p>"We'll see you at breakfast, then?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said in a casual tone, continuing on her
way.</p>

<p>"Not surely?"</p>

<p>"Why not come and see?" The words were wafted
back to us provocatively upon the evening air.</p>

<p>"We will! Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>We walked some little way in silence.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock!" murmured my companion presently
in a reflective, rueful tone. "We must turn in early."</p>

<p>We did turn in early, and we should have been asleep
early was it not for the fact that among the chief wonders
of Columbus must be ranked its roosters&mdash;birds of
a ghastly habit of nocturnal vocalism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>But though these creatures interfered somewhat with
our slumbers, and though eight is an early hour for us,
we reached the neighboring house next morning five
minutes ahead of time. And though the manner of the
elder sister was, as before, austere, that made no difference,
for the younger sister was there.</p>

<p>After breakfast we dallied, chatting with her for a
time; then a bell began to toll, and my companion reminded
me that I had an engagement to visit the Industrial
Institute and College before leaving.</p>

<p>It was quite true. I had made the engagement the
day before, but it had been my distinct understanding
that he was to accompany me; for if anything disconcerts
me it is to go alone to such a place. However
sweet girls may be as individuals, or in small groups,
they are in the mass diabolically cruel, and their cruelty
is directed especially against men. I know. I have
walked up to a college building to pay a call, while thirty
girls, seated on the steps, played, sang, and whistled an
inane marching tune, with the rhythm of which my steps
could not but keep time. I have been the only man in a
dining-room full of college girls. A hundred of them
put down their knives and forks with a clatter as I entered,
and a hundred pairs of mischievously solemn eyes
followed my every movement. Voluntarily to go
through such experiences alone a man must be in love.
And certainly I was not in love with any girl at the Industrial
Institute.</p>

<p>"We both have an engagement," I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't go," he returned.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I have two sketches to make before train time."</p>

<p>"You're going to make me go over there <i>alone</i>?"</p>

<p>"I don't care whether you go or not," he replied mercilessly.
"You made the engagement. I had nothing to
do with it. But I am responsible for the pictures."</p>

<p>Perceiving that it was useless to argue with him, I reluctantly
departed and, not without misgivings, made my
way to the Industrial Institute.</p>

<p>I am thankful to say that there matters did not turn
out so badly for me as I had anticipated. I refused to
visit classrooms, and contented myself with gathering
information. And since the going to gather this information
cost me such uneasiness, I do not propose to
waste entirely the fruits of my effort, but shall here
record some of the facts that I collected.</p>

<p>The Industrial Institute and College is for girls of sixteen
years or over who are graduates of high schools.
There are about 800 students taking either the collegiate,
normal, industrial, or musical courses, or combination
courses. This college, I was informed, was the
first in the country to offer industrial education to
women.</p>

<p>Most of the students come from families in modest
circumstances, and attend the college with the definite
purpose of fitting themselves to become self-supporting.
The cost is very slight, the only regular charge, aside
from board and general living expenses, being a nominal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
matriculation fee of $5. There is no charge for rooms
in the large dormitories connected with the college.
Board, light, fuel, and laundry are paid for co&ouml;peratively,
the average cost per student, for all these,
being about ten dollars a month&mdash;which sum also includes
payment for a lyceum ticket and for two hats per
annum. Uniforms are worn by all, these being very
simple navy-blue suits with sailor hats. Seniors and
juniors wear cap and gown. All uniform requirements
may be covered at a cost of twenty dollars a year, and
a girl who practices economy may get through her college
year at a total cost of about $125, though of course
some spend considerably more.</p>

<p>Many students work their way, either wholly or in
part. Thirty or forty of them serve in the dining room,
for which work they are allowed sixty-five dollars a
year. Others, who clean classrooms are allowed fifty
dollars a year, and still others earn various sums by
assisting in the library or reading room or by doing secretarial
work.</p>

<p>Unlike the other departments of the college, the
musical department is not a tax upon the State, but is
entirely self-sustaining, each girl paying for her own
lessons. This department is under the direction of Miss
Weenonah Poindexter, to whose enthusiasm much if not
all of its success is due. Miss Poindexter began her
work in 1894, as the college's only piano teacher, giving
lessons in the dormitories. Now she not only has a
splendid music hall and a number of assistants, but has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
succeeded in making Columbus one of the recognized
musical centers of the South, by bringing there a series
of the most distinguished artists: Paderewski, Nordica,
Schumann-Heinck, Gadski, Sembrich, Bispham,
Albert Spaulding, Maud Powell, Damrosch's Orchestra,
and Sousa's Band.</p>

<p>So much I had learned of the I.&nbsp;I. and C. when it came
time for me to flee to the train. My companion and I
had already packed our suitcases, and it had been arranged
between us that, instead of consuming time by
trying to meet and drive together to the station, we
should work independently, joining each other at the
train.</p>

<p>I left the college in an automobile, stopping at Mrs.
Eichelberger's only long enough to get my suitcase. As
I drove on past the next corner I chanced to look up the
intersecting street. There, by a lilac bush, stood my
companion. He was not alone. With him was a very
pretty girl wearing a soft black dress and a corsage of
narcissus. But the corsage was now smaller, by one
flower, than it had been before, for, as I sighted them,
she was in the act of placing one of the blooms from her
bouquet in my companion's buttonhole. Her hands
looked very white and small against his dark coat, and
I recall that he was gazing down at them, and that his
features were distorted by a sentimental smile.</p>

<span class="caption">Her hands looked very white and small against his dark coat. He was gazing

</div>

<p>"Come on!" I called to him.</p>

<p>He looked up. His expression was vague.</p>

<p>"Go along," he returned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you come with me now?"</p>

<p>"I'll be there," he replied. "You buy the tickets and
check the baggage." And with that he turned his back.</p>

<p>"Good-by," I called to the young lady. But she was
looking up at him and didn't seem to hear me.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My companion arrived at the station in an old hack,
with horses at the gallop. He was barely in time.</p>

<p>When we were settled in the car, bowling along over
the prairies toward the little junction town of Artesia,
I turned to him and inquired how his work had gone that
morning. But at that moment he caught sight, through
the car window, of some negroes sitting at a cabin door,
and exclaimed over their picturesqueness.</p>

<p>I agreed. Then, as the train left them behind, I repeated
my question: "How did your work go?"</p>

<p>"This is very fertile-looking country," said he.</p>

<p>This time I did not reply, but asked:</p>

<p>"Did you finish both sketches?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "Not both. There wasn't time."</p>

<p>"Let's see the one you did."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he returned, "I didn't do any.
You know how it is. Sometimes a fellow feels like
drawing&mdash;sometimes he doesn't. Somehow I didn't
feel like it this morning."</p>

<p>With that he lifted the lapel of his coat and, bending
his head downward, sniffed in a romantic manner at the
sickeningly sweet flower in his buttonhole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<br />
VICKSBURG OLD AND NEW</h2>


<p>I should advise the traveler who is interested in
cities not to enter Vicksburg by the Alabama &amp;
Vicksburg Railroad, which has a dingy little station
in a sort of gulch, but by the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi
Valley Railroad&mdash;a branch of the Illinois Central&mdash;which
skirts the river bank and flashes a large first impression
of the city before the eyes of alighting passengers.</p>

<p>The station itself is a pretty brick colonial building,
backed by a neat if tiny park maintained by the railroad
company, and facing the levee (pronounce "<i>lev</i>-vy"),
along which the tracks are laid. Beyond the
tracks untidy landing places are scattered along the
water front, with here and there a tall, awkward, stern-wheel
river steamer tied up, looking rather like an old-fashioned
New Jersey seacoast hotel, covered with
porches and jimcrack carving, painted white, embellished
with a cupola and a pair of tall, thin smokestacks,
and set adrift in its old age to masquerade in maritime
burlesque.</p>

<p>At other points along the bank are moored a heterogeneous
assortment of shanty boats of an incredible
and comic slouchiness. Some are nothing but rafts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
made of water-soaked logs, bearing tiny shacks knocked
together out of driftwood and old patches of tin and
canvas, but the larger ones have barges, or the hulks
of old launches, as their foundation. These curious
craft are moored in long lines to the half-submerged
willow and cottonwood trees along the bank, or to stakes
driven into the levee, or to the railroad ties, or to whatever
objects, ashore, may be made fast an old frayed
rope or a piece of telephone wire. Long, narrow planks,
precariously propped, connect them with the river bank,
so that the men, women, children, dogs, and barnyard
creatures who inhabit them may pass to and fro. Some
of the boats are the homes of negro families, some of
whites. On some, negro fish markets are conducted, advertised
by large catfish dangling from their posts and
railings.</p>

<span class="caption">In some of the boats negro fish-markets are conducted, advertised by large catfish dangling from posts and railing</span>
</div>

<p>Whether fishing for market, for personal use, or
merely for the sake of having an occupation involving
a minimum of effort, the residents of shanty boats&mdash;particularly
the negroes&mdash;seem to spend most of their
days seated in drowsy attitudes, with fish poles in their
hands. Their eyes fall shut, their heads nod in the sun,
their lines lag in the muddy water; life is uneventful,
pleasant, and warm.</p>

<p>When Porter's mortar fleet lay in the river, off Vicksburg,
bombarding the town, that river was the Mississippi,
but though it looks the same to-day as it did then,
it is not the Mississippi now, but the Yazoo River.
This comes about through one of those freakish changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
of course for which the great stream has always been
famous.</p>

<p>In the old days Vicksburg was situated upon one of
the loops of a large letter "S" formed by the Mississippi,
but in 1876 the river cut through a section of land and
eliminated the loop upon which the town stood. Fortunately,
however, the Yazoo emptied into the Mississippi
above Vicksburg, and it was found possible, by digging
a canal, to divert the latter river from its course and
lead its waters into the loop left dry by the whim of
the greater stream. Thus the river life, out of which
Vicksburg was born, and without which the place would
lose its character, was retained, and the wicked old Mississippi,
which has played rough pranks on men and
cities since men and cities first appeared upon its banks,
was for once circumvented. This is but one item from
the record of grotesque tricks wrought by changes in
the river's course: a record of farms located at night
on one side of the stream, and in the morning on the
other; of large tracts of land transferred from State
to State by a sudden switch of this treacherous fluid line
of boundary; of river boats crashing by night into dry
land where yesterday a deep stream flowed; of towns
built up on river trade, utterly dependent upon the river,
yet finding themselves suddenly deserted by it, like wives
whose husbands disappear, leaving them withering, helpless,
and in want.</p>

<p>Where the upper Mississippi, above St. Louis, flows
between tall bluffs it attains a grandeur which one ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>pects
in mighty streams, but that is not the part of the
river which gets itself talked about in the newspapers
and in Congress, nor is it the part of the river one involuntarily
thinks of when the name Mississippi is mentioned.
The drama, the wonder, the mystery of the
Mississippi are in the lower river: the river of countless
wooded islands, now standing high and dry, now
buried to the tree tops in swirling torrents of muddy
water; the river of black gnarled snags carried downstream
to the Gulf with the speed of motor boats; the
river whose craft sail on a level with the roofs of
houses; the river of broken levees, of savage inundations.</p>

<p>The upper river has a beauty which is like that of some
lovely, stately, placid, well-behaved blond wife. She is
conventional and correct. You always know where to
find her. The lower river is a temperamental mistress.
At one moment she is all sweetness, smiles and playfulness;
at the next vivid and passionate. Even when she
is at her loveliest there is always the possibility of sudden
fury: of her rising in a rage, breaking the furniture,
wrecking the house&mdash;yes, and perhaps winding her
wicked cold arms about you in a final destroying embrace.</p>

<p>Being the "Gibraltar of the river" (albeit a Gibraltar
of clay and not of rock), Vicksburg does not suffer
when floods come. Turn your back upon the river, as
you stand on the platform of the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi
railroad station, and you may gather at a glance an im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>pression
of the town piling up the hillside to the eastward.</p>

<p>The first buildings, occupying the narrow shelf of
land at the water's edge, are small warehouses, negro
eating houses, dilapidated little steamship offices, and
all manner of shacks in want of paint and repairs.
From the station Mulberry Street runs obliquely up the
hillside to the south. This street, which forms the main
thoroughfare to the station, used to be occupied by
wholesale houses, but has more lately been given over
largely to a frankly and prominently exposed district of
commercialized vice&mdash;negro and white. Not only is it
at the very door of Vicksburg, but it parallels, and is
but one block distant from, the city's main street.</p>

<p>Other streets, so steep as hardly to be passable, directly
assault the face of the hill, mounting abruptly to
Washington Street, which runs on a flat terrace at about
the height of the top of the station roof, and exposes
to the view of the newly arrived traveler the unpainted
wooden backs of a number of frame buildings which,
though they are but two or three stories high in front,
reach in some cases a height of five or six stories at
the rear, owing to the steepness of the hillside to which
they cling. The roof lines, side walls, windows, chimneys,
galleries, posts, and railings of these sad-looking
structures are all picturesquely out of plumb, and some
idea of the general dilapidation may be gathered from
the fact that, one day, while my companion stood on
the station platform, drawing a picture of this scene, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
brick chimney, a portrait of which he had just completed,
softly collapsed before our eyes, for all the world like
a sitter who, having held a pose too long, faints from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>A brief inspection of the life on the galleries of these
foul old fire traps reveals them as negro tenements; and,
though they front on the main street of Vicksburg, it
should be explained that about here begins the "nigger
end" of Washington Street&mdash;the more prosperous
portion of the downtown section lying to the southward,
where substantial brick office buildings may be
seen.</p>

<p>Between the ragged, bulging tenements above are occasional
narrow gaps through which are revealed cinematographic
glimpses of street traffic; and over the tenement
roofs one catches sight of sundry other buildings,
these being of brick, and, though old, and in no way
imposing, yet of a more prosperous and self-respecting
character than the nearer structures.</p>

<p>Altogether, the scene, though it is one to delight an
etcher, is not of a character to inspire hope in the heart
of a humanitarian, or an expert on sanitation or fire
prevention. Nor, indeed, would it achieve completeness,
even on the artistic side, were it not for its crowning
feature. Far off, over the roofs and above them,
making an apex to the composition, and giving to the
whole picture a background of beauty and of ancient
dignity, rises the graceful white-columned cupola of
Vicksburg's old stone courthouse, partially obscured by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
a feathery green tree top, hinting of space and foliage
upon the summit of the hill.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pamphlets on Vicksburg, issued by railroad companies
for the enticement of tourists, give most of their space
to the story of the campaign leading to Grant's siege of
Vicksburg and to descriptions of the various operations
in the siege&mdash;the battlefield, now a national military
park, being considered the city's chief object of interest.</p>

<p>Though I am not constitutionally enthusiastic about
seeing battlefields, I must admit that I found the field
of Vicksburg engrossing. The siege of a small city presents
a comparatively simple and compact military problem
which is, therefore, comprehensible to the civilian
mind, and in addition to this the Vicksburg battlefield is
splendidly preserved and marked, so that the visitor may
easily reconstruct the conflict.</p>

<p>The park, which covers the fighting area, forms a
loose crescent-shaped strip over the hills which surround
the city, its points abutting on the river above and below.
The chief drives of the park parallel each other, the
inner one, Confederate Avenue, following, as nearly as
the hills permit, the city's line of defense, while the
other, Union Avenue, forms an outer semicircle and follows,
in a similar manner, the trenches of the attacking
forces.</p>

<p>That the battlefield is so well preserved is due in part
to man and in part to Nature. Many of the hills of
Warren County, in which Vicksburg is situated, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
composed of a curious soft limy clay, called marl, which,
normally, has not the solidity of soft chalk. Marse
Harris Dickson, who knows more about Vicksburg&mdash;and
also about negroes, common law, floods, funny
stories, geology, and rivers&mdash;than any other man in Mississippi,
tells me that this marl was deposited by the
river, in the form of silt, centuries ago, and that it was
later thrown up into hills by volcanic action. He did
not live in Vicksburg when this took place, but deduces
his facts from the discovery of the remains of shellfish
in the soil of the hills.</p>

<p>Whatever its geological origin, this soil has some very
strange characteristics. In composition it is neither
stone nor sand, but a cross between the two&mdash;brown and
brittle. One can easily crush it to dust in one's hand,
in which form it has about the consistency of talcum
powder, and it may be added that when this brown powder
is seized by the winds and whirled about, Vicksburg
becomes one of the most mercilessly dusty cities on this
earth.</p>

<p>On exposed slopes the marl washes very badly, forming
great caving gullies, but, curiously enough, where it
is exposed perpendicularly it does not wash, but slicks
over on the outside, and stands almost as well as soft
sandstone, although you can readily dig into it with your
fingers.</p>

<p>Many of the highways leading in and out of the city
pass between tall walls of this peculiar soil, through
deep cuts which a visitor might naturally take for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
result of careful grading by the road builders; but
Marse Harris Dickson tells me that the cuts are entirely
the result of erosion wrought by a hundred years of
wheeled traffic.</p>

<p>So far as I know there is but one man who has witnessed
this phenomenon without being impressed.
That man is Samuel Merwin. Merwin went down and
visited Marse Harris in Vicksburg, and saw all the
sights. He was polite about the battlefield, and the
river, and the negro stories, and everything else, until
Marse Harris showed him how the highways had eroded
through the hills. That did not seem to impress him
at all. Moreover, instead of being tactful, he started
telling about his trip to China. In China, he said, there
were similar formations, but, as the civilization of China
was much older than that of Vicksburg (fancy his having
said a thing like that!) the gorges over there had
eroded to a much greater extent. He said he had seen
them three hundred feet deep.</p>

<p>The more Marse Harris tried to get him to say something
a little bit complimentary about the Vicksburg erosions,
the more Merwin boasted about China. He declared
that the Vicksburg erosions didn't amount to a
hill of beans compared with what he could show Marse
Harris if Marse Harris would go with him to a certain
point on the banks of the Wa Choo, in the province of
Lang Pang Si.</p>

<p>Evidently he harped on this until he touched not only
his host's local pride, but his pride of discovery. Be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>fore
that, Marse Harris had been content to stick around
in Mississippi, with perhaps a little run down to New
Orleans for Mardi Gras, or up to Dogtail to see a break
in the levee, but after Merwin's talk about China he
began to grow restless, and it is generally said in Vicksburg
that it was purely in order to have something to
tell Merwin about, the next time he saw him, that he
made his celebrated trip to the source of the Nile. As
for Merwin, he has never been invited back to Vicksburg,
and it is to be observed that, even to this day,
Marse Harris, by nature of a sunny disposition, shows
signs of erosion of the spirit when China is mentioned.</p>

<p>It is apropos the battlefield that I mention the peculiarities
of the soil. Had the bare ground been exposed
to the rains of a few years, the details of redoubts,
trenches, gun positions, saps, and all other military
works would have melted away. Fortunately, however,
there is a kind of tough, strong-rooted grass, called
Bermuda grass, indigenous to that part of the country,
and this grass quickly covered the battlefield, holding
the soil together so effectually that all outlines are practically
embalmed. So, although those in charge of the
park have contributed not a little to its preservation&mdash;putting
old guns in their former places, perpetuating
saps with concrete work, and placing white markers on
the hillsides, to show how far up those hillsides the assaulting
Union troops made their way in various historic
charges&mdash;it is due most of all to Nature that the Vicksburg
battlefield so well explains itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>Could Grant and Pemberton look to-day upon the hills
and valleys where surged their six weeks' struggle for
possession of the city, I doubt that they would find any
important landmark wanting, and it is certain that they
could not say, as Wellington did when he revisited
Waterloo: "They have spoiled my battlefield!"</p>

<p>Besides the old guns and the markers, the field is
dotted over with observation towers and all manner of
memorials. Of the latter, the marble pantheon erected
by the State of Illinois, and the beautiful marble and
bronze memorial structure of the State of Iowa, are
probably the finest. The marble column erected by Wisconsin
carries at its summit a great bronze effigy of
"Old Abe," the famous eagle, mascot of the Wisconsin
troops. Guides to the battlefield are prone to relate
to visitors&mdash;especially, I suspect, those whose accents
betray a Northern origin&mdash;how "Old Abe," the bird of
battle, went home and disgraced himself, after the war,
by his ungentlemanly action in laying a setting of eggs.</p>

<p>The handsomest monument to an individual which I
saw upon the battlefield was the admirable bronze bust
of Major General Martin L. Smith, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., and the
one which appealed most to my imagination was also
a memorial to a Confederate soldier: Brigadier-General
States Rights Gist. Is there not something Roman
in the thought that, thirty or more years before
the war, a southern father gave his new-born son
that name, dedicating him, as it were, to the cause of
States Rights, and that the son so dedicated gave his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
life in battle for that cause? The name upon that stone
made me better understand the depth of feeling that
existed in the South long years before the War, and
gave me a clearer comprehension of at least one reason
why the South made such a gallant fight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of more than fourscore national cemeteries in the
United States, that which stands among the hills and
trees, overlooking the river, at the northerly end of the
military park, is one of the most beautiful, and is, with
the single exception of Arlington, the largest. It contains
the graves of nearly 17,000 Union soldiers lost in
this campaign&mdash;three-fourths of them "unknown"!</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, because the surrender
of Pemberton to Grant occurred on July 4, that date
has, in this region, associations less happy than attach
to it elsewhere, and that the Fourth has not been celebrated
in Vicksburg since the Civil War, except by the
negroes, who have taken it for their especial holiday.
This reminds me, also, of the fact that, throughout the
South, Christmas, instead of the Fourth of July, is celebrated
with fireworks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

SHREDS AND PATCHES</h2>


<p>It was Marse Harris Dickson who showed us the
battlefield. As we were driving along in the motor
we overtook an old trudging negro, very picturesque
in his ragged clothing and battered soft hat. My
companion said that he would like to take a picture of
this wayfarer, and asked Marse Harris, who, as author
of the "Old Reliable" stories, seemed best fitted for the
task, to arrange the matter. The automobile, having
passed the negro, was stopped to wait for him to catch
up. Presently, as he came by, Marse Harris addressed
him in that friendly way Southerners have with negroes.</p>

<p>"Want your picture taken, old man?" he asked.</p>

<p>To which the negro, still shuffling along, replied:</p>

<p>"I ain't got no money."</p>

<p>Marse Harris, knowing the workings of the negro
mind, got the full import of this reply at once, but I
must confess that a moment passed before I realized
that the negro took us for itinerant photographers looking
for trade.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Irvin S. Cobb, I suppose
Marse Harris has the largest collection of negro
character stories of any individual in this country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
And let me say, in this connection, that I know of no
better place than Vicksburg for the study of southern
negro types.</p>

<p>One day Marse Harris was passing by the jail. It
was hot weather, and the jail windows were open. Behind
the bars of one window, looking down upon the
street, stood a negro prisoner. As Marse Harris passed
this window a negro wearing a large watch chain came
by in the other direction. His watch chain evidently
caught the eye of the prisoner, who spoke in a wistful
tone, demanding:</p>

<p>"What tahme is it, brotha?"</p>

<p>"What foh you want t' know what tahme it is?" returned
the other sternly, as he continued upon his way.
"You ain't goin' nowhere."</p>

<p>Through Marse Harris I obtained a copy of a letter
written by a negro named Walter to Mr. W.&nbsp;H.
Reeve of Vicksburg. Walter had looked out for Mr.
Reeve's live stock during a flood, and had certain ideas
about what should be done for him in consequence. I
give the letter exactly as it was written, merely inserting,
parenthetically, a few explanatory words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mr. H W Reeve an bos dear sir I like to git me a par [pair]
second hand pance dont a fail or elce I will be dout [without] a
pare to go eny where so send me something. Dont a fail an send
me a par of youre pance [or] i will hafter go to work for somebody
to git some. I don't think you all is treating me right at all

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<p>Though I cannot see just why it should be so, it
seemed to us that the Vicksburg negroes were happier
than those of any other place we visited. Whether
drowsing in the sun, walking the streets, doing a little
stroke of work, fishing, or sitting gabbling on the curbstone,
they were upon the whole as cheerful and as comical
a lot of people as I ever saw.</p>

</div>

<p>"Wha' you-all goin' to?" I heard a negro ask a group
of mulatto women, in clean starched gingham dresses,
who went flouncing by him on the street one Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Oh," returned one of the women, with the elaborate
superiority of a member of the class of idle rich, "we're
just serenadin' 'round."</p>

<p>"Serenading," as she used the word, meant a promenade
about the town.</p>

<p>Perhaps the happiness of the negro, here, has to do
with the lazy life of the river. The succulent catfish is
easily obtainable for food, and the wages of the roustabout&mdash;or
"rouster," as he is called for short&mdash;are good.</p>

<p>The rouster, in his red undershirt, with a bale hook
hung in his belt, is a figure to fascinate the eye. When
he works&mdash;which is to say, when he is out of funds&mdash;he
works hard. He will swing a two-hundred-pound
sack to his back and do fancy steps as he marches with
it up the springy gangplank to the river steamer's deck,
uttering now and then a strange, barbaric snatch of
song. He has no home, no family, no responsibilities.
An ignorant deck hand can earn from forty to one hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>dred
dollars a month. Pay him off at the end of the
trip, let him get ashore with his money, and he is gone.
Without deck hands the steamer cannot move. For
many years there has been known to river captains a
simple way out of this difficulty. Pay the rousters off
a few hours before the end of the trip. Say there are
twenty of them, and that each is given twenty dollars.
They clear a space on deck and begin shooting craps.
No one interferes. By the time the trip ends most of
the money has passed into the hands of four or five; the
rest are "broke" and therefore remain at work.
Yet despite the ingenuity of those who have the negro
labor problem to contend with, Marse Harris tells me
that there have been times when the levee was lined
with steamers, full-loaded, but unable to depart for want
of a crew. Not that there was any lack of roustabouts
in town, but that, money being plentiful, they would not
work. In such times perishable freight rots and is
thrown overboard.</p>

<p>I am conscious of a tendency, in writing of Vicksburg,
to dwell continually upon the negro and the river
for the reason that the two form an enchanting background
for the whole life of the place. This should not,
however, be taken to indicate that Vicksburg is not a
city of agreeable homes and pleasant society, or that its
only picturesqueness is to be found in the river and
negro life.</p>

<p>The point is that Vicksburg is a patchwork city.
The National Park Hotel, its chief hostelry, is an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>usually
good hotel for a city of this size, and Washington
Street, in the neighborhood of the hotel, has the look
of a busy city street; yet on the same square with the
hotel, on the street below, nearer the river, is an unwholesome
negro settlement. So it is all over the city;
the "white folks" live on the hills, while the "niggers"
inhabit the adjacent bottoms. Nor is that the only
sense in which the town is patched together. Some of
the most charming of the city's old homes are tucked
away where the visitor is not likely to see them without
deliberate search. Such a place, for example, is the old
Klein house, standing amid lawns and old-fashioned
gardens, on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi. This
house was built long before the railroad came to Vicksburg,
cutting off its grounds from the river. A patch
in the paneling of the front door shows where a cannon
ball passed through at the time of the bombardment,
and the ball itself may still be seen embedded in the
woodwork of one of the rooms within.</p>

<span class="caption">The old Klein house, standing amid lawns and old-fashioned gardens on the bluff overlooking the river</span>
</div>

<p>And there are other patches. Near the old courthouse,
which rears itself so handsomely at the summit
of a series of terraces leading up from the street, are a
number of old sand roads which must be to-day almost
as they were in the heyday of the river's glory, when
the region in which the courthouse stands was the principal
part of the city&mdash;the days of heavy drinking and
gambling, dueling, slave markets, and steamboat races.
These streets are not the streets of a city, but of a small
town. So, too, where Adams Street crosses Grove, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
has the appearance of a country lane, the road represented
by a pair of wheel tracks running through the
grass; but Cherry Street, only a block distant, is built up
with city houses and has a good asphalt pavement and
a trolley line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span></p>

<p>As inevitably as water flows down the hills of
Vicksburg to the river, the visitor's thoughts
flow down always to the great spectacular, historic,
mischievous, dominating stream.</p>

</div>

<p>Mark Twain, in that glorious book, "Life on the
Mississippi," declared, in speaking of the eternal problems
of the Mississippi, that as there are not enough
citizens of Louisiana to take care of all the theories
about the river at the rate of one theory per individual,
each citizen has two theories. That is the case to-day
as it was when Mark Twain was a pilot. I have heard
half a dozen prominent men, some of them engineers,
state their views as to what should be done. Each view
seemed sound, yet all were at variance.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, that part of the river lying between
Vicksburg and the mouth. Here, quite aside
from the problem as to the hands in which river-control
work should be vested&mdash;a very great problem in itself&mdash;three
separate and distinct physical problems are presented.</p>

<p>From Vicksburg to Red River Landing there are
swift currents which deposit silt only at the edge of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
bank, or on sand bars. From Red River Landing to
New Orleans the problem is different; here the channel
is much improved, and slow currents at the sides of the
river, between the natural river bank and the levee, deposit
silt in the old "borrow pits"&mdash;pits from which the
earth was dug for the building of the levees&mdash;filling
them up, whereas, farther up the river, the borrow pits,
instead of filling up, are likely to scour, undermining
the levee. From New Orleans to the head of the Passes&mdash;these
being the three main channels by which the river
empties into the Gulf&mdash;the banks between the natural
river bed and the levees build up with silt much more
rapidly than at any other point on the entire stream;
here there are no sand bars, and the banks cave very
little. In this part of the river it is not current, but
wind, which forms the great problem, for the winds are
terrific at certain times of year, and when they blow
violently against the current, waves are formed which
wash out the levees.</p>

<p>This is the barest outline of three chief physical problems
with which river engineers must contend. There
are countless others which have to be met in various
ways. In some places the water seeps through, under
the levee, and bubbles up, like a spring, from the ground
outside. This, if allowed to continue, soon undermines
the levee and causes a break. The method of fighting
such a seepage is interesting. When the water begins
to bubble up, a hollow tower of sand-filled sacks is built
up about the place where it comes from the ground, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
when this tower has raised the level of the water within
it to that of the river, the pressure is of course removed,
on the siphon principle.</p>

<p>As river-control work is at present handled, there is
no centralization of authority, and friction, waste, and
politics consequently play a large part.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the situation in the State of
Louisiana. Here control is, broadly speaking, in the
hands of three separate bodies: (1) the United States
army engineer, who disburses the money appropriated
by Congress for levees and bank revetment, working
under direction of the Mississippi River Commission;
(2) the State Board of Engineers, which disburses
Louisiana State funds wherever it sees fit, and which,
incidentally, does not use, in its work, the same specifications
as are used by the Government; and (3) the
local levee boards, of which there are eight in Louisiana,
one to each river parish&mdash;a parish being what is elsewhere
called a county. Each of these eight boards
has authority as to where parish money shall be spent
within its district, and it may be added that this last
group (considering the eight boards as a unit) has the
largest sum to spend on river work.</p>

<p>The result of this division of authority creates chaos,
and has built up a situation infinitely worse than was
faced by General Goethals when Congress attempted to
divide control in the building of the Panama Canal. It
will be remembered that, in that case, a commission was
appointed, but that Roosevelt circumvented Congress by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
making General Goethals head of the commission with
full powers.</p>

<p>While the canal was in course of construction, General
Goethals appeared before the Senate Committee on
Commerce. When asked what he knew of levee building
and work on the Mississippi, he replied:</p>

<p>"I don't know a single, solitary thing about the work
on the Mississippi except that it is being carried on under
the annual appropriation system. If we had that
system to hamper us, the Panama Canal would not be
completed on time and within the estimate, as it will
be. That system leaves engineers in uncertainty as to
how much they may plan to do in the year ahead of
them. Big works cannot be completed economically,
either as to time or money, unless the man who is making
the plan can proceed upon the theory that the money
will be forthcoming as fast as he can economically spend
it."</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, I cannot myself claim to be
free from river theory. It seems to me clear that the
Mississippi should be under exclusive Federal control
from source to mouth; that the various commissions
should be abolished, and that the whole matter should
be in the hands of the chief of United States Engineers,
who would have ample funds with which to carry on
work of a permanent character.</p>

<p>As one among countless items pointing to the need
of Federal control, consider the case of the Tensas Levee
Board, one of the eight local boards in Louisiana. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
board does not build any levees whatsoever in the
State of Louisiana, but does all its work with Louisiana
money, in the State of Arkansas, where it has
constructed, and maintains, eighty-two miles of levees,
protecting the northeastern corner of Louisiana from
floods which would originate in Arkansas. These same
levees, however, also protect large tracts of land in Arkansas,
for which protection the inhabitants of Arkansas
do not pay one cent, knowing that their Louisiana
neighbors are forced, for their own safety, to do the
work.</p>

<p>Cairo, Illinois, is the barometer of the river's rise
and fall, the gage at that point being used as the basis
for estimates for the entire river below Cairo. These
estimates are made by computations which are so accurate
that Vicksburg, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans
know, days or even weeks in advance, when to expect
high water, and within a few inches of the precise height
the floods will reach.</p>

<p>Some years since, the United States engineer in charge
of a river district embracing a part of Louisiana, notified
the local levee boards that unusually high water
might be expected on a certain date and that several
hundred miles of levees would have to be "capped" in
order to prevent overflow. The local boards in turn notified
the planters, in sections where capping was necessary.</p>

<p>One of the planters so notified was an old Cajun&mdash;Cajun
being a corruption of the word "Acadian," denot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>ing
those persons of French descent driven from Acadia,
in Canada, by the British many years ago. This old
man did not believe that the river would rise as high as
predicted and was not disposed to cap his levee.</p>

<p>"But," said the member of the local levee board, who
interviewed him, "the United States engineer says you
will have to put two twelve-inch planks, one above the
other, on top of your levee, and back them with earth, or
else the water will come over."</p>

<p>At last the old fellow consented.</p>

<p>Presently the floods came. The water mounted,
mounted, mounted. Soon it was halfway up the lower
plank; then it rose to the upper one. When it reached
the middle of that plank the Cajun became alarmed and
called upon the local levee board for help to raise the
capping higher still.</p>

<p>"No," said the local board member who had given
him the original warning, "that will not be necessary.
I have just talked to the United States engineer. He
says the water will drop to-morrow."</p>

<p>The old man was skeptical, however, and was not satisfied
until the board member agreed that in case the
flood failed to abate next day, as predicted, the board
should do the extra capping. This settled, a nail was
driven into the upper plank to mark the water's height.</p>

<p>Sure enough, on the following morning the river had
dropped away from the nail, and thereafter it continued
to fall.</p>

<p>After watching the decline for several days, the Ca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>jun,
very much puzzled, called on his friend, the local
levee board member, to talk the matter over.</p>

<p>"Say," he demanded, "what kinda man dis United
States engineer is, anyhow? Firs' he tell when de water
comes. Den he tell jus' how high she comes. Den he
tell jus' when she's agoin' to fall. What kinda man is
dat, anyhow? Is he been one Voodoo?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The spirit of the people of Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Louisiana, who live, in flood time, in the precarious
safety afforded by the levees, is characterized by the
same optimistic fatalism that is to be found among the
inhabitants of the slopes of Vesuvius in time of eruption.</p>

<p>One night, a good many years ago, I ascended Vesuvius
at such a time, and I remember well a talk I had
with a man who gave me wine and sausage in his house,
far up on the mountain side, at about two o'clock that
morning.</p>

<p>Seventeen streams of lava were already flowing
down, and signs of imminent disaster were at hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid to stay here with your family?"
I asked the man.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "Three times I have seen it worse
than this. I have lived here always, and"&mdash;with a good
Italian smile&mdash;"it is evident, signore, that I am still
alive."</p>

<p>Less than a week later I read in a newspaper that
this man's house, which was known as Casa Bianca, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>gether
with his vineyards and his precious wine cellars,
tunneled into the mountain side, had been obliterated by
a stream of lava.</p>

<p>Precisely as he went about his affairs when destruction
threatened, so do the planters along the Mississippi.
But there is this difference: against Vesuvius no precaution
can avail; whereas, in the case of a Mississippi
flood, foresight may save life and property. For instance,
many planters build mounds large enough to accommodate
their barns, and all their live stock. Likewise,
when floods are coming, they construct false floors
in their houses, elevating their furniture above high-water
mark, so that, if the whole house is not carried
away, they may return to something less than utter
ruin. It is the custom, also, to place ladders against
trees, in the branches of which provisions are kept in
time of danger, and to have skiffs, containing food and
water, ready on the galleries of the houses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<br />
OLD RIVER DAYS</h2>


<p>Among the honored citizens of Vicksburg, at the
time of our visit, were a number of old steamboat
men who knew the river in its golden days;
among them, Captain "Mose" Smith, Captain Tom
Young, Captain W.&nbsp;S. ("Billy") Jones, and Captain S.&nbsp;H.
Parisot&mdash;the latter probably the oldest surviving
Mississippi River captain.</p>

<p>We were sent to see Captain Parisot at his house,
where he received us kindly, entertained us for an hour
or more with reminiscences, and showed us a most interesting
collection of souvenirs of the river, including
photographs of famous boats, famous deck loads of cotton,
and famous characters: among the latter the celebrated
rivals, Captain John W. Cannon of the <i>Robert
E. Lee</i> and Captain Thomas P. Leathers of the <i>Natchez</i>.
Captain Parisot knew both these men well, and was himself
aboard the <i>Lee</i> at the time of her famous race with
the <i>Natchez</i> from New Orleans to St. Louis.</p>

<p>"We left New Orleans 3&frac12; minutes ahead of the
<i>Natchez</i>," said Captain Parisot, "made the run to Vicksburg
in 24 hours and 28 minutes, beat her to Cairo by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
1 hour and 12 minutes, and to St. Louis by more than 3
hours."</p>

<p>Captain Parisot's father was a soldier under Napoleon
I, and moved to Warren County, Mississippi,
after having been wounded at Moscow. He built, at
the foot of Main Street, Vicksburg, the first brick house
that city had.</p>

<p>"There was a law in France," said the captain, "that
any citizen absent from the country for thirty-five years
lost all claim to property. My father's people were
pretty well off, so in '42 he started back, but he was
taken ill and died in New Orleans."</p>

<p>Captain Parisot was born in 1828, and in 1847 began
"learning the river." In 1854 he became part owner of
a boat, and three years later purchased one of his
own.</p>

<p>"I bought her in Cincinnati," he said. Then, reflectively,
he added: "There was a good deal of drinking
in those days. When I brought her down on her first
trip I had 183 tons of freight, and 500 barrels of whisky,
from Cincinnati, for one little country store&mdash;Barksdale
&amp; McFarland's, at Yazoo City."</p>

<p>"There was a good deal of gambling, too, wasn't
there?" one of us suggested.</p>

<p>"There was indeed," smiled the old captain. "Every
steamboat was a gambling house, and there used to be
big games before the war."</p>

<p>"How big?"</p>

<p>"Well," he returned, "as Captain Leathers once put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
it, it used to be 'nigger ante and plantation limit.' And
that's no joke about playing for niggers either. Those
old planters would play for anything. I've known people
to get on a boat at Yazoo City to come to Vicksburg,
and get in a game, and never get off at Vicksburg
at all&mdash;just go back to Yazoo; yes, and come down
again, to keep the game going.</p>

<p>"There was a saloon called the Exchange near our
house in Yazoo, and I remember once my father got
into a game, there, with a gambler named Spence
Thrift. That was before the war. Thrift was a terrible
stiff bluffer. When he got ready to clean up,
he'd shove up his whole pile. Well, he did that to my
father. Thrift's pile was twenty-two hundred dollars,
and all my father had in front of him was eight hundred.
But he owned a young negro named Calvin, so he called
Calvin, and told him: 'Here, boy! Jump up on the
table.' That equalled the gambler's pile; and it finished
him&mdash;he threw down his hand, beaten.</p>

<p>"Business in those times was done largely on friendship.
It used to be said that I 'owned' the Yazoo River
when I was running my line. I knew everybody up
there. They were my friends, and they gave me their
business for that reason, and also because I brought the
cotton down here to Vicksburg, and reshipped it from
here on, down the river. It was considered an advantage
to reship cotton because moving it from one boat to
another knocked the mud off the bales.</p>

<p>"There used to be some enormous cargoes of cotton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
carried. The largest boat on the river was the <i>Henry
Frank</i>, owned by Frank Hicks of Memphis. She ran
between Memphis and New Orleans, and on one trip
carried 9226 bales. Those were the old-style bales, of
course. They weighed 425 to 450 pounds each, as
against 550 to 600 pounds, which is the weight of a bale
to-day, now that powerful machinery is used to make
them. The heavy bale came into use partly to beat
transportation charges, as rates were not made by
weight, but at so much per bale.</p>

<p>"The land up the Yazoo belonged to the State, and
the State sold it for $1.25 per acre. The fellows that
got up there first weren't any too anxious to see new
folks coming in and entering land. Used to try all kinds
of schemes to get them out.</p>

<p>"There were two brothers up there named Parker.
One of them was a surveyor&mdash;we called him 'Baldy'&mdash;and
the other was lumbering, getting timber out of the
cypress breaks and rafting it down. Almost all the
timber used from Vicksburg to New Orleans came out
of there.</p>

<p>"One time a man came up the Yazoo to take up land
and went to stop with Baldy Parker. When they sat
down to dinner Baldy took some flour and sprinkled it
all over his meat.</p>

<p>"'What's that?' asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"'Quinine,' says Baldy. 'Haven't you got any?'</p>

<p>"'No,' says the fellow; 'what would I want it for?'</p>

<p>"'You'll find out if you go out there in the swamps,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
Baldy tells him. 'It's full of malaria. We eat quinine
on everything.'</p>

<p>"The fellow was quiet through the rest of the meal.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon they got up to go out, and Baldy took up
a pair of stovepipes.</p>

<p>"'What do you do with them pipes?' asks the stranger.</p>

<p>"'Wear 'em, of course,' says Baldy. 'Haven't you
got any?'</p>

<p>"'No,' says the fellow. 'What for?'</p>

<p>"'Why,' says Baldy, 'the rattlesnakes out there will
bite the legs right off of you.'</p>

<p>"With that the fellow had enough. He didn't go
any farther, but turned around and took the boat down
the river."</p>

<p>In all his years as captain and line owner on the river,
Captain Parisot never lost a vessel. "I never insured
against sinking," he told us. "Just against fire. But
I got the best pilots I could hire. In all I built twenty-seven
steamboats. I had $150,000 worth of boats when
I sold my line in 1880. After I sold they did lose some
boats."</p>

<p>Later we saw Captain "Billy" Jones, a much younger
man than Captain Parisot, yet old enough to have known
the river in its prime. Captain Jones deserted the river
years ago, and is now a golfer with a prosperous banking
business on the side.</p>

<p>"Captain Parisot was right when he said business on
the river was done largely on friendship," said Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Jones. "Also business used to be turned down for the
opposite reason. There was a historic case of that in
this town.</p>

<p>"Captain Tom Leathers was in the habit of refusing
to take freight on the <i>Natchez</i> if he didn't like the
shipper or the consignee. For some reason or other he
had it in for the firm of Lamkin &amp; Eggleston, wholesale
grocers here in Vicksburg, and declined their freight.
They sued him in the Circuit Court and got judgment.
Leathers carried the case to the Supreme Court, but the
verdict was sustained and he had to pay $2500 damages.
He was furious.</p>

<p>"'What's the use,' he said, 'of being a steamboat captain
if you can't tell people to go to hell?'"</p>

<p>It is the lamentable fact, and I must face it, and so
must you if you intend to read on, that the language
of the river was rough. At least ninety-nine out of
every hundred river stories are, therefore, not printable
in full. Either they must be vitiated by deletions, or
interpreted at certain points by blanks and "blanketys."
As for me, I prefer the blankety-blanks and I consider
that this method of avoiding the complete truth relieves
me of all responsibility. And of course, if that is
so, it absolves, at the same time, good Captain "Billy"
Jones, or any one else who may have happened to tell me
the stories.</p>

<p>Both Leathers and Cannon were large, powerful men,
and they always hated each other. Leathers was never
popular, for he was very arrogant, but he had a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
reputation for pushing the <i>Natchez</i> through on time.
Also, such friends as he did have always stuck by him.</p>

<p>Something of the feeling between the two old river
characters is revealed in the following story related by
Captain Jones:</p>

<p>"Ed Snodgrass, who lived in St. Joseph, La., was a
friend of both Cannon and Leathers. When the <i>Natchez</i>
would arrive at St. Joseph, he would go and give
Leathers news about Cannon, and when the <i>Lee</i> came in
he would see Cannon and tell him about Leathers.</p>

<p>"Well, one time Leathers was laid up with a carbuncle
on his back, and brought a doctor up on the boat
with him. So, of course, Ed Snodgrass told Cannon
about it when he came along.</p>

<p>"'A carbuncle, eh?' said Cannon.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Ed.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said Cannon, 'you tell the old blankety-blank-blank
that I had a brother&mdash;a bigger, stronger
man than I am&mdash;and he had one o' them things and died
in two weeks.'</p>

<p>"Soon after that Cannon made a misstep when backing
the <i>Natchez</i> out, at Natchez, and fell, breaking his
collar bone. Of course Ed Snodgrass gave the news to
Leathers when he came along.</p>

<p>"'Huh!' said Leathers. 'His collar bone, eh? You
tell the old blankety-blank-blank that I wish it had been
his blankety-blank neck!'"</p>

<p>I asked Captain Jones for stories about gambling.</p>

<p>"After the war," he said, "there weren't the big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
poker games there used to be. Mostly we had sucker
games then. There was a gambler named George
Duval who wrote a book&mdash;or, rather, he had somebody
write it for him, for he was a very ignorant fellow, and
began his life calking the seams of boats in a shipyard.
He had a partner who was known as 'Jew Mose,' who
used to dress like a rich planter. He wore a broad-brimmed
hat and a very elegant tail coat, and was a big,
handsome man.</p>

<p>"After the boat left New Orleans, this 'Jew Mose'
would disguise himself with whiskers and goggles, go to
the barber shop and lay out his game. George Duval
and a fellow called 'Canada Bill' were the cappers.
They would bring in suckers, get their money, and generally
get off the boat about Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>"Once when I was a clerk on the <i>Robert E. Lee</i>,
Duval got a young fellow in tow, and the young fellow
wanted to bet on the game, but he had a friend with him,
and his friend kept pulling him away.</p>

<p>"Later, when Duval had given up the idea of getting
this young fellow's money, and closed up his game, he
appeared in the social hall of the boat with a small bag
held up to his face.</p>

<p>"Somebody asked him what was in the bag.</p>

<p>"'It's hot salt,' he said. 'I've got a toothache, and a
bag of hot salt is the best thing in the world for toothache.'</p>

<p>"Presently, when he went to his stateroom to get
something, he left the bag of salt on the stove to heat it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
up. While he was gone somebody suggested, as a
joke, that they dump out the salt and fill the bag with
ashes, instead. So they did it. And when Duval came
back he held it up to his face again, and seemed perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>"'How does it feel now?' one of the fellows asked.</p>

<p>"'Fine,' said Duval. 'Hot salt is the best thing
going.'</p>

<p>"At that, the man who had prevented the young fellow
from betting, down in the barber shop, earlier in the
day, offered to bet Duval a hundred dollars that the bag
didn't contain salt.</p>

<p>"Duval took the bet and raised him back another hundred.
But the man had only fifty dollars left. However,
another fellow, standing in the crowd, put in the
extra fifty to make two hundred dollars a side.</p>

<p>"Then Duval opened the bag, and it <i>was</i> salt. He
had changed the bags, and the fellows who worked up
the trick were his cappers."</p>

<p>One of the old-time river gamblers was an individual,
blind in one eye, known as "One-eyed Murphy." Murphy
was an extremely artful manipulator of cards, and
made a business of cheating. One day, shortly after
the <i>Natchez</i> had backed out from New Orleans and got
under way, Marion Knowles, a picturesque gentleman
of the period, and one who had the reputation of being
polite even in the most trying circumstances, and no
matter how well he had dined, came in and stood for a
time as a spectator beside a table at which Murphy was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
playing poker with some guileless planters. Mr.
Knowles was not himself guileless, and very shortly he
perceived that the one-eyed gambler was dealing himself
cards from the bottom of the pack. Thereupon he drew
his revolver from his pocket and rapping with it on the
table addressed the assembly:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, speaking in courtly fashion,
"I regret to say that there is something wrong here. I
will not call any names, neither will I make any personal
allusions. <i>But if it doesn't stop, damn me if I don't
shoot his other eye out!</i>"</p>

<p>I cannot drop the river, and stories of river gambling,
without referring to one more tale which is a
classic. It is a long story about a big poker game, and
to tell it properly one must know the exact words. I do
not know them, and therefore shall not attempt to tell
the whole story, but shall give you only the beginning.</p>

<p>It is supposed to be told by a Virginian.</p>

<p>"There was me," he says, "and another very distinguished
gentleman from Virginia and a gentleman from
Kentucky, and a man from Ohio, and a fellow from
New York, and a blankety-blank from Boston&mdash;"</p>

<p>That is all I know of the story, but I can guess who
got the money in that game.</p>

<p>Can't you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX"></a>CHAPTER XLIX<br />
<br />
WHAT MEMPHIS HAS ENDURED</h2>


<p>An article on Memphis, published in the year 1855,
gives the population of the place as about
13,000 (one quarter of the number slaves), and
calls Memphis "the most promising town in the Southwest."
It predicts that a railroad will some day connect
Memphis with Little Rock, Arkansas, and that a direct
line between Memphis and Cincinnati may even be constructed.
This article begins the history of Memphis
in the year 1820, when the place had 50 inhabitants.
In 1840 the settlement had grown to 1,700, and fifteen
years thereafter it was almost eight times that
size.</p>

<p>Your Memphian, however, is not at all content to
date from 1820. He begins the history of Memphis
with the date May 8, 1541&mdash;a time when Henry VIII
was establishing new matrimonial records in England,
when Queen Elizabeth was a little girl, and Shakespeare,
Bacon, Galileo and Cromwell were yet unborn.
For that was the date when a Spanish gentleman bearing
some personal resemblance to "Uncle Joe" Cannon&mdash;though
he was younger, had black hair and beard,
was differently dressed and did not chew long black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
cigars&mdash;arrived at the lower Chickasaw Bluffs, from
which the city of Memphis now overlooks the Mississippi
River. This gentleman was Hernando De Soto,
and with his soldiers and horses he had marched from
Tampa Bay, Florida, hunting for El Dorado, but finding
instead, a lot of poor villages peopled by savages
whom he killed in large numbers, having been brought
up to that sort of work by Pizarro, under whom he
served in the conquest of Peru. It seems to be well
established, through records left by De Soto's secretary,
and other men who were with him, and through landmarks
mentioned by them, that De Soto and his command
camped where Memphis stands, crossed the Mississippi
at this point in boats which they built for the
purpose, and marched on to an Indian village situated
on the mound, a few miles distant, which now gives
Mound City, Arkansas, its name. One hundred and
thirty-two years later Marquette passed by on his way
down the river, and nine years after him La Salle, but
so far as is known, neither stopped at the site of Memphis,
though they must have noticed as they passed,
that the river is narrower here than at any point within
hundreds of miles, and that the Chickasaw Bluffs afford
about as good a place for a settlement as may be found
along the reaches of the lower river, being high enough
for safety, and flat on top. The first white man known
to have visited the actual site of Memphis after De
Soto, was De Bienville, the French Governor of Louisiana,
who came in 1739. De Bienville found the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>Chickasaw
village where De Soto had found it two centuries
earlier; but whereas De Soto managed to avoid battle
with the inhabitants of this particular village, De Bienville
came to attack them. He fought them near their
village, was defeated, and retired to Mobile.</p>

<p>Thus this part of the United States belonged first to
Spain, and then to France; but in 1762 France ceded
it back to Spain, and in the year following, Spain and
France together ceded their territory in the eastern part
of the continent to England. The next change came
with the Revolution, when the United States came into
being. The Spanish were, however, still in possession of
the vast territory of Louisiana, to the west of the Mississippi.
In 1795, Gayoso, Spanish Governor of Louisiana,
came across and built a fort on the east side of the
river, but was presently ousted by the United States.
In 1820, as has been said, the settlement of Memphis had
begun, one of the early proprietors having been Andrew
Jackson. Some of the first settlers wished to name the
place Jackson, in honor of the general, but Jackson himself,
it is said, decided on the name Memphis, because
the position of the town suggested that of ancient
Memphis, on the Nile.</p>

<p>In 1857 Memphis got her first railroad&mdash;the Memphis
&amp; Charleston&mdash;connecting her with Charleston, South
Carolina. About the time the road was completed there
were severe financial panics which held the city back;
also there was trouble, as in so many other river towns,
with hordes of gamblers and desperadoes. Judge J.&nbsp;P.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
Young, in his "History of Memphis," tells of an interesting
episode of those times. There were two professional
gamblers, father and son, of the name of Able.
The father shot a man in a saloon brawl, and soon after,
the son committed a similar crime of violence. A great
mob started to take the younger Able out of jail and
lynch him, but one firm citizen, addressing them from the
balcony of a hotel, persuaded them to desist. Next day,
however, there was a mass meeting to discuss the case
of Able. At this meeting the hotheads prevailed, and
Able was taken from the jail by a mob of three thousand
men. When the noose was around his neck, and
he and his mother and sister were pleading that his life
be spared, the same man who had previously prevented
mob action, stepped boldly up, cut the rope from Abel's
neck, and assisted him to fly, standing between him and
the mob, fighting the mob off, and finally getting Able
back into the jail. When the mob stormed the jail,
furious at having been circumvented by a single man,
the same powerful figure appeared at the jail door with
a pistol, and, incredible though it seems, actually held
the mob at bay until it finally dispersed. This man was
Nathan Bedford Forrest, later the brilliant Confederate
cavalry leader. Forrest and his wife are buried in
Memphis, in a square called Forrest Park, under a fine
equestrian monument, by C.&nbsp;H. Niehaus.</p>

<p>Before the war Forrest was a member of the slave-dealing
firm of Forrest &amp; Maples, of Memphis. Subjoined
is a photographic reproduction of an advertise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>ment

<p>When the Civil War loomed close, sentiment in Memphis
was divided, but at a call for troops for the Union,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
the State of Tennessee balked, and soon after it seceded
from the Union and joined the Confederacy. Many
people believed, at that time, that if the entire South
united, the North would not dare fight. When the war
came, however, Memphis knew where she stood; it is
said that no city of the same size (22,600) furnished so
many men to the Confederate armies. In 1862, when
the Union forces got control of the river to the north
and the south of the city, it became evident that Memphis
was likely to be taken. A fleet of Union gunboats
came down and defeated the Confederate fleet in the
river before the city, while the populace lined the banks
and looked on. The city, being without military protection,
then surrendered, and was occupied by troops
under Sherman. Nor, with the exception of one period
of a few hours' duration, did it ever again come under
Confederate control. That was when Forrest made his
famous raid in 1864, an event which exhibited not only
the dash and hardihood of that intrepid leader, but also
his strategy and his sardonic humor.</p>

<p>General A.&nbsp;J. Smith, with 13,000 Union soldiers was
marching on the great grain district of central Mississippi,
and was forcing Forrest, who had but 3,500 men,
to the southward. Unable to meet Smith's force on
anything like equal terms, Forrest conceived the idea
of making a "run around the end" and striking at Memphis,
which was Smith's base. Taking 1,500 picked
men and horses, he executed a flanking movement over
night, and before Smith knew he was gone, came career<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>ing
into Memphis at dawn at the head of 500 galloping,
yelling men&mdash;many of them Memphis boys. There
were some 7,000 Union troops in and about Memphis at
this time, but they were surprised out of their slumbers,
and made no effective resistance. The only part of Forrest's
plan which miscarried was his scheme to capture
three leading Union officers, who were then stationed
in Memphis: Generals C.&nbsp;C. Washburn, S.&nbsp;A. Hurlbut
and R.&nbsp;P. Buckland. General Hurlbut's escape occurred
by reason of the fact that instead of having
passed the night at the old Gayoso Hotel, where he made
his headquarters, he happened to be visiting a brother
officer, elsewhere. General Washburn was warned by
a courier and made his escape in his nightclothes and
bare feet from the residence he occupied as headquarters,
running down alleys to the river, and thence along
under the bluff to the Union fortifications. Forrest's
men found the general's papers, uniform, hat, boots
and sword in his bedroom, and also found there Mrs.
Washburn. The only things they failed to find were
the general's nightshirt and the general himself, who
was inside it. General Buckland also avoided capture
by the narrowest margin. The soldiers first went to the
wrong house to look for him. That gave him time to
escape.</p>

<p>It is recorded that, later in the day, under a flag of
truce, Forrest sent General Washburn his sword and
clothing with a humorous message, informing him, at
the same time, that he had 600 Federal prisoners with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>out
shoes or clothing, and that he would like supplies
for them. The supplies, we are told, were promptly
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Forrest waited until he was sure that news of the
raid had been telegraphed to General Smith in the field.
Then he cut the wires. Smith immediately came back
toward Memphis with his army, which was what Forrest
desired him to do. The Confederates then retired
from the immediate vicinity of the city.</p>

<p>Judge Young, in his history, reports that when General
Hurlbut heard of the raid he exclaimed, "There it
goes again! They superseded me with Washburn because
I could not keep Forrest out of West Tennessee,
and Washburn cannot keep him out of his own bedroom!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After the War there was corruption and carpet-bag
rule in Memphis, and Forrest was again to the fore,
becoming "Grand Wizard" of the famous Ku Klux
Klan, the mysterious secret organization designed to intimidate
Scalawags, Carpet-baggers and negroes, whose
arrogance had become intolerable. General George W.
Gordon prepared the oath and ritual for the Klan, which
was founded in the town of Pulaski, Giles County, Tennessee.
General Forrest took the oath in 1866, in Room
10 of the old Maxwell House, at Nashville.</p>

<p>It is my belief that the Ku Klux Klan has been a good
deal maligned. Many of its members were men of high
type. I have been told, for instance, that one southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
gentleman who has since been in the cabinet of a President
of the United States, was active in the Ku Klux.
I withhold his name because the purposes of the Ku
Klux Klan, and the urgent need which called it into being,
are not yet fully understood in the North, and for
the further reason that depredations committed by other
bodies were frequently charged to the Ku Klux, giving
it a bad name. So far as I can discover the Ku Klux
endeavored to avoid violence where it could be avoided.
Its aim seems to have been to frighten negroes and bad
whites into behaving themselves or going away; though
sometimes, of course, bad characters had to be killed.
It must be remembered that the ballot was denied
former Confederate soldiers for quite a period after the
War, that they were not allowed to possess firearms,
and that, at the same time, negro troops were quartered
in the South. In many parts of the South the government
and the courts were in the hands of third-rate
Northerners (carpet-baggers) who had come down to
dominate the defeated section, and who used the Scalawags
(disloyal southern whites) and negroes for their
own purposes. Obviously this was outrageous, and
equally obviously, a proud people, even though defeated,
could not endure it. The service performed by the Ku
Klux Klan seems to have been comparable with that
rendered by the Vigilantes of early western days.
Something had to be done and the Klan did it.</p>

<p>In 1869 General Forrest ordered the Klan to disband,
which it did; but owing to the fact that it was a secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
organization, and that disguises had been used, it was an
easy matter for mobs, not actually associated with the
Ku Klux, to assume its costume and commit outrages in
its name.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In writing of Raleigh I referred to the post-bellum
activities of the Confederate cruiser <i>Shenandoah</i>. Captain
Dabney M. Scales, a distinguished citizen of Memphis,
was on the <i>Shenandoah</i>. Born in Orange County,
Virginia, in 1842, Captain Scales was appointed to the
Naval Academy by L.&nbsp;Q.&nbsp;C. Lamar. He was a classmate
of Captain Clark, later of the <i>Oregon</i>. When the
war broke out, young Scales was in his second year at
the Academy, but like most of the other southern cadets
he resigned and offered his services to the South. When
commissioned he was the youngest naval officer in the
Confederate service. Eight months after the War was
over, the <i>Shenandoah</i> was still cruising in the South
Seas, looking for Federal merchantmen. In January
1866, somewhere south of Australia, she overhauled the
British bark <i>Baracouta</i>, taking her for a Yankee man-o'-war
flying the British flag as a ruse. Young Scales
was sent in command of a boarding party, and was informed
by the skipper of the <i>Baracouta</i> that the Civil
War had terminated months and months ago. The
<i>Shenandoah</i> then made for Liverpool. In the meantime
a Federal court had ruled that her officers were
guilty of piracy&mdash;a hanging offense. Naturally, they
did not dare return to the United States. Young Scales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
went to Mexico and remained there two years before
coming home. When the Spanish War came, Captain
Scales volunteered and was made navigating officer of a
naval vessel. At the time of our visit he was a practising
lawyer in Memphis, and was in command of Company
A of the Uniform Confederate Veterans, a body
of old heroes who go out every now and then and win
the first prize for the best drilled organization operating
Hardee's tactics.</p>

<p>Another distinguished citizen of Memphis who has
lively recollections of the Civil War, is the Right Reverend
Thomas F. Gailor, Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee.
Bishop Gailor, who succeeded the famous Bishop Quintard,
is my ideal of everything an Episcopal bishop&mdash;or
I might even say a Church of England bishop&mdash;ought
to be. The Episcopal Church seems to me to have about
it more "style" than most other churches, and an Episcopal
bishop ought not to look the ascetic. He ought to
be well filled out, well dressed, well fed. He ought to
have a distinguished appearance, a ruddy complexion,
a good voice, and a lot of what we call "humanness"&mdash;including
humor. All these qualities Bishop Gailor has.</p>

<p>In the bishop's study, in Memphis, hangs the sword
of his father, Major Frank M. Gailor, who commanded
the 33rd Mississippi Regiment. Major Gailor
was killed while giving a drink of water to a wounded
brother officer, and that officer, though dying, directed
a soldier to take the Major's sword and see that it
reached Mrs. Gailor, in Memphis, within the Union<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
lines. A young woman, a Confederate spy, took the
sword, and wearing it next her body, brought it through
to Mrs. Gailor. Somehow or other it became known
that the widow had her husband's sword, and as the possession
of arms was prohibited to citizens, a corporal
and guard were sent to the house to search for it. They
found it between the mattresses of Mrs. Gailor's bed,
and confiscated it. Mrs. Gailor then went with another
lady to see General Washburn. Her friend started a
long harangue upon the injustice which had been done,
but Mrs. Gailor, seeing that the General was becoming
impatient, broke in saying: "General, soldiers came to
my house and took away my dead husband's sword. I
can't use it, nor can my little son. I want it back. You
would want your boy to have your sword, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would!" cried Washburn. "Thank
God for a woman who can say what she has to say, and
be done with it!"</p>

<p>The sword was returned.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1863, when Bishop Gailor was a
child of about seven years, he accompanied his mother
on a journey by wagon from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi.
The only other member of the party was a
lady who had driven in the same wagon from Jackson
to Kentucky, to get the body of her brother, a Confederate
soldier who had been killed there. The coffin containing
the remains was carried in the wagon. When
it was known in Memphis that Mrs. Gailor was going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
through the lines, a great many people came to her with
letters which they wished to send to friends. Mrs.
Gailor sewed many of the letters into the clothing of the
little boy. ("I remember it well," said the bishop. "I
felt like a mummy.") Also one of Forrest's spies came
with important papers, asking if she would undertake
to deliver them. Only by very clever manipulation did
Mrs. Gailor get the papers through, for everything was
carefully searched. After they had passed out of the
northern lines they met one of Forrest's pickets. Mrs.
Gailor told him that she had papers for the general, and
before long Forrest rode up with his staff and received
them. Then the two women and the little boy, with
their tragic burden in the wagon, drove along on their
two-hundred mile journey. And later, when Jackson
was bombarded, they were there.</p>

<p>Before the war Major Gailor had been editor of the
Memphis "Avalanche," a paper which was suppressed
when the Union troops took the town. After the War
the "Avalanche" was started up again, and had a stormy
time of it, because it criticized a Carpet-bag judge who
had come to Memphis. In 1889 the "Avalanche" was
consolidated with the "Appeal," another famous ante-bellum
journal, surviving to-day in the "Commercial-Appeal,"
a strong newspaper, edited by one of the ablest
journalists in the South, Mr. C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;J. Mooney.</p>

<p>When Memphis was captured the "Appeal" would
have been suppressed, as the "Avalanche" was, had it
been there. But when it became evident that Memphis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
would fall, Mr. S.&nbsp;C. Toof (later a well-known book
publisher) who was then connected with the "Appeal,"
packed up the press and other equipment and shipped
them to Grenada, Mississippi, where Mr. B.&nbsp;F. Dill,
editor of the paper, continued to bring it out. When
Grenada was threatened, a few months later, Mr. Dill
moved with his newspaper equipment to Birmingham,
where for a second time he resumed publication. His
next move was to Atlanta. There, when he could not
get news-print, he used wallpaper, or any sort of paper
he could lay his hands on. When Sherman took Atlanta
the "Appeal" moved again, this time to Columbus,
Georgia, where, at last, it was captured, and its press
destroyed. Wherever it went it remained the "Memphis
Daily Appeal," with correspondents in all southern
armies. No wonder a paper with such vitality as that,
has survived and become great!</p>

<p>Poor Memphis! After the War she had Reconstruction
to contend with; after Reconstruction, financial difficulties;
after that, pestilence. In 1873, when the population
of the city was about 40,000, and there had been
a long period of hard times, yellow fever broke out.
The condition of the city was exceedingly unsanitary,
and after the pestilence had passed, was allowed to remain
so, though at that time the origin of yellow fever
was, of course, not known, and it was assumed that the
disease resulted from lack of proper sanitation.</p>

<p>In 1878 there was another yellow fever epidemic.
The first case developed August 2, but the news was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
suppressed until the middle of the month, by which time
a number of cases had come down. The day after the
news became known 22 new cases were reported. Terror
spread through the town. Hordes of people tried
to flee at once. Families left their houses with the doors
wide open and silver standing on the sideboards. People
flocked to the trains; when they could not get seats they
stood in the aisles or clambered onto the roofs of the
cars; if they could not get in at car doors they climbed
in through the windows, and sometimes, when the father
of a family was refused admittance to a crowded
car, he would force a way in for his wife and children
at the pistol's point.</p>

<p>In the first week of the panic there were 1,500 cases,
with an average of ten deaths daily; in the next week,
3,000 cases with fifty deaths daily, and so on into September
during which month there was an average of
8,000 to 10,000 cases with about two hundred deaths a
day.</p>

<p>Not every one fled, however. Leading citizens remained,
forming a relief committee, and some brave
helpers came from outside. Thus the sick and needy
were attended to, though of course many of the volunteers
contracted the disease and perished.</p>

<p>Added to the epidemic there was, as so often happens
in such circumstances, an outbreak of thievery and other
crime, which had to be put down. It is related that in
the height of the epidemic hardly any one was seen upon
the streets save an occasional nurse, doctor, or other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
member of the relief committee; household pets starved
to death or fled the city; among the newspapers the
staffs were so reduced that only two or three men were
left in each office, and in the case of the "Appeal," but
one, that one Colonel J.&nbsp;M. Keating, the proprietor, who
stuck to Memphis and for a time wrote, set up and
printed the paper without assistance, feeling that refugees
must have news from the city.</p>

<p>The next year the epidemic came again, but in less
violent form, there being, this time, but 2,000 cases.
However the effect was cumulative. Memphis dropped
from a city of nearly 50,000 to one of 20,000 and the
reputation of the place was such that a bill was proposed
in Congress to purchase the ground on which the
city stood and utterly destroy it as unfit for human
habitation.</p>

<p>Stricken as she was, however, Memphis "came back."
A great campaign for sanitation was begun; city sewage-disposal
was installed, and after a few years, artesian
wells were bored for a new water supply. And though,
as we now know, yellow fever does not come from the
same sources as typhoid, nevertheless the new sanitary
measures did greatly reduce the city's death rate.</p>

<p>Memphis, like all other cities, has her troubles now
and then, but since the great pestilence there has never
been a real disaster. The city has grown and thriven.
Indeed, she had become so used to growing fast that
when, in 1910, the Federal census gave her but 131,000,
she indignantly demanded a recount, for she had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
talking to herself, and had convinced herself that she had
a great many more than that number of inhabitants.
However, the census was taken again, and the first count
proved accurate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>

MODERN MEMPHIS</h2>


<p>To be charmed by the social side of a city, yet to
find little to admire in its physical aspect, is like
knowing a brilliant and beautiful woman whose
housekeeping is not of the neatest. If one were compelled
to discuss such a woman, and wished to do so sympathetically
but with truth, one might avoid brutal comment
on the condition of her rooms by likening them to
other rooms elsewhere: rooms which one knew to be
untidy, but which the innocent listener might not understand
to be so. By this device one may even appear to
pay a compliment, while, in reality, indicating the grim
truth. In such a case, I, for example, might say that
this supposititious lady's rooms reminded me of those
I occupied on the second floor of the famous restaurant
called Antoine's, in New Orleans; whereupon the
reader, knowing the high reputation of Antoine's cuisine,
and never having seen the apartments to which I
refer, might assume an implication very favorable.</p>

<p>Let me say, then, that Memphis reminds me of St.
Louis. Like St. Louis, Memphis has charming society.
Like St. Louis she has pretty girls. Like St. Louis she
is hospitable. And without particularizing too much, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
may say that her streets remind me of St. Louis streets,
that many of her houses remind me of St. Louis houses,
and that her levee, with its cobbled surface sloping
down to the yellow, muddy Mississippi, the bridges in
the distance, the strange looking river steamers loading
and unloading below, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is
much like the St. Louis levee. So, if the reader happens
to be unfamiliar with the physical appearance of
St. Louis, he may, at all events, perceive that I have
likened Memphis to a much larger city&mdash;thus, (it seems
fair to suppose) paying Memphis a handsome tribute.</p>

<p>Memphis has a definite self-given advantage over St.
Louis in possessing a pretty little park at the heart of
the city, overlooking the river; also she has the advantage
of lying to the east of the great stream, instead
of to the west, so that, in late afternoon, when the
sun splashes down into the mysterious deserted reaches
of the Arkansas flats, across the way, sending splatterings
of furious color across the sky, one may seat oneself
on a bench in the park and witness a stupendous
natural masterpiece. A sunset over the sea can be no
more wonderful than a sunset over this terrible, beautiful,
inspiring, enigmatic domineering flood. Or one
may see the sunset from the readingroom of the Cossitt
Library, with its fine bay window commanding the
river almost as though it were the window of a pilot-house.</p>

<p>The Cossitt Library is only one of several free libraries
in the city. There is, for example, a free library<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
in connection with the Goodwyn Institute, an establishment
having an endowment of half a million dollars,
left to Memphis by the late William A. Goodwyn.
The Goodwyn Institute provides courses of free lectures,
by well-known persons, on a great variety of
subjects. The library is designed to add to the educational
work. Books are not, however, loaned, as they
are from the Cossitt Library, an institution to which I
found myself returning more than once; now for a
book, now to look at the interesting collection of mound-builder
relics contained in an upper room, now merely
because it is a place of such reposeful hospitality that
I liked to make excuses to go back.</p>

<p>The library, a romanesque building of Michigan red
sandstone, is by a southern architect, but is in the style
of Richardson, and is one of the few buildings in that
style which I have ever liked. It was given to Memphis
as a memorial to Frederick H. Cossitt, by his three
daughters, Mrs. A.&nbsp;D. Juilliard, Mrs. Thomas Stokes,
and Mrs. George E. Dodge, all of New York. Mr.
Cossitt was born in Granby, Connecticut, but as a young
man moved South and in 1842 adopted Memphis as
his home, residing there until 1861. At the outbreak
of the Civil War he made an amicable division of his
business with his partner, and removed to New York,
where he resided until the time of his death. Finding
among his papers a memorandum indicating that he had
intended to endow a library in Memphis, his daughters
carried out his wish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p>Having already spoken of a number of Memphis'
interesting citizens, I find myself left with an ill-assorted
trio of names yet to be mentioned, because, different
as they are, each of the three supplies a definite
part of the character of the city. First, then, Memphis
has the honor of possessing what not many of our
cities possess: a man who stands high among the world's
artist-bookbinders. This gentleman is Mr. Otto Zahn,
executive head of the publishing house of S.&nbsp;C. Toof &amp;
Co. Mr. Zahn himself has done some famous bindings,
and books bound by him are to be found in some
of the finest private libraries in the land. Until a few
years ago he conducted an art-bindery in connection with
the Toof company's business, but it was unprofitable
and finally had to be given up.</p>

<p>Second, to descend to a more popular form of art,
but one from which the revenue is far more certain,
Memphis has, in W.&nbsp;C. Handy, a negro ragtime composer
whose dance tunes are widely known. Among
his compositions may be mentioned the "Memphis
Blues," the "St. Louis Blues," "Mr. Crump," and "Joe
Turner." "Mr. Crump" is named in honor of a former
mayor of Memphis who was ousted for refusing to
enforce the prohibition law; "Joe Turner" is the name
of a negro pianist who plays for Memphis to dance&mdash;as
Handy also does. Most of Handy's tunes are negro
"rags" in fox-trot time, and they are so effective that
Memphis dances them generally in preference to the one
step.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>

<p>My third celebrity is of a more astounding type.
While in Memphis I called aboard the river steamer
<i>Grand</i>, and had a talk with Mrs. Nettie Johnson, who is
captain of that craft. Some one told me that Mrs.
Johnson was the only woman steamboat captain in the
world, but she informed me that at Helena, Arkansas,
there lives another Mrs. Johnson&mdash;no relative of hers&mdash;who
follows the same calling.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Grand</i> is almost entirely a Johnson family
affair. Mrs. Johnson is captain; her husband, I.&nbsp;S.
Johnson is pilot (though Mrs. Johnson has, in addition
to her master's license, a pilot's license, and often takes
the wheel); her elder son, Emery, is clerk; Emery's wife
is assistant clerk, while Arthur, the captain's younger
son, is engineer. Russell Johnson, Mrs. Johnson's
grandson, is the only member of the family I saw aboard
the boat who does not take part in running it. Russell
was five years old when I met him, but that was nearly a
year ago, and by now he is probably chief steward, boatswain,
or ship's carpenter.</p>

<p>The regular route of the <i>Grand</i> is from Memphis to
Mhoon's Landing, on the Arkansas River, a round trip
of 120 miles, with thirty landings.</p>

<p>I asked Mrs. Johnson if she had ever been shipwrecked.
Indeed she had! Her former ship, the <i>Nettie Johnson</i>,
struck thin ice one night in the Arkansas
River and went down.</p>

<p>"What did you do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I reached after an iron ring," she replied, "and clumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
on up into the rigging. She went down about four-thirty
<span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> and we stayed on her till daylight; then
we all swum ashore. I tell you it was cold! There
was icicles on my dress; my son Emery put his arms
around me to keep me warm, and his clothes froze onto
mine."</p>

<p>"How long a swim was it to shore?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh," put in her husband, "it didn't amount to nothing.
She was only swimming about two minutes."</p>

<p>This statement, however, was repudiated by the captain.
"Two minutes, my foot!" she flung back at her
spouse. "It was more than that, all right!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson has done flood rescue work for the Government,
with the <i>Grand</i>. In the spring previous to
our visit she rescued sixty families from one plantation,
besides towing barge-loads of provisions to various
points on the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers.</p>

<p>Captaining and piloting a river boat are clearly good
for the health. Mrs. Johnson looks too young to be a
grandmother. Her skin is clear, her cheeks are rosy,
her brown eyes flash and twinkle, her voice, somewhat
hoarse from shouting commands, is deep and strong, and
her laugh is like the hearty laugh of a big man.</p>

<p>"Are you a suffragist?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" was her reply.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you want to talk like that for?" objected
her husband. "You know women ought to be
allowed to vote."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she returned firmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p>At that her daughter-in-law, the assistant clerk of the
<i>Grand</i>, took up the cudgels.</p>

<p>"Of course they ought to vote!" she insisted. "You
know <i>you</i> can do just as good as a man can do!"</p>

<p>"No," asseverated Captain Nettie. "Women ought
to stay home and tend to their families."</p>

<p>"As you do?" I suggested, mischievously.</p>

<p>"That's all right!" she flung back. "I stayed home
and raised my family until it was big enough to do its
own navigating. Then I started in steamboating. I
had to have <i>something</i> to do."</p>

<p>But the daughter-in-law did not intend to let the
woman suffrage issue drop.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," she demanded of Captain
Nettie, "that you think women haven't got as much
sense as men?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do!" the captain tossed back. "There never
was a woman on earth that had as much sense as the
men. Take it from me, that's so. I know what I'm
talking about&mdash;and that's more than a half of these
other women do!"</p>

<p>Then, as it was about time for the <i>Grand</i> to cast off,
Captain Nettie terminated the interview by blowing the
whistle; whereupon my companion and I went ashore.</p>

<p>One of the best boats on the river is the <i>Kate Adams</i>
and one of the most delightful two-days' outings I can
imagine would be to make the round trip with her from
Memphis to Arkansas City. But if I were seeking rest
I should not take the trip at the time when it is taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
by a score or more of Memphis young men and women,
who, with their chaperones, and with Handy to play
their dance-music, make the <i>Kate Adams</i> an extremely
lively craft on one round trip each year.</p>

<p>Apropos of Arkansas, I am reminded that Memphis
is not only the metropolis of Tennessee, but is the big
city of Arkansas and Mississippi, as well. The Peabody
Hotel in Memphis, a somewhat old-fashioned hostelry,
is a sort of Arkansas political headquarters, and
is sometimes humorously referred to as "Peabody township,
Arkansas." It is also used to a considerable extent
by Mississippi politicians, as well as by the local
breed. The Peabody grill has a considerable reputation
for good cookery, and the Peabody bar, though it
still looks like a bar, serves only soft drinks, which are
dispensed by female "bartenders." The Gayoso hotel,
named for the Spanish governor who intruded upon
Memphis territory for a time, stands where stood the
old Gayoso, which figured in Forrest's raid. The Gayoso
made me think a little of the old Victoria, in New
York, torn down some years ago. The newest hotel
in town, at the time of our visit, was the Chicsa, an establishment
having a large and rather flamboyant office,
and considerably used, we were told, as a place for conventions.
If I were to go again to Memphis I should
have a room at the Gayoso and go to the Peabody for
meals.</p>

<p>The axis of the earth, which Oliver Wendell Holmes
declared, "sticks out visibly through the center of each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
and every town or city," sticks out in Memphis at Court
Square, which the good red Baedeker dismisses briefly
with the remark that it "contains a bust of General Andrew
Jackson and innumerable squirrels." This is not
meant to indicate that the squirrels are a part of the
bust of Jackson. The two are separate and distinct.
So are the pigeons which alight on friendly hands and
shoulders as do other confident pigeons on Boston Common,
and in the Piazza San Marco, in Venice.</p>

<p>I am always disposed to like the people of a city in
which pigeons and squirrels are tame. Every day, at
noon, an old policeman, a former Confederate soldier I
believe he is, comes into the square with a basket of corn.
When he arrives all the pigeons see him and rush toward
him in a great flapping cloud, brushing past your
face if you happen to be walking across the square at
the time. Nor is he the only one to feed them. Numbers
of citizens go at midday to the square, where they
buy popcorn and peanuts for the squirrels and pigeons&mdash;which,
by the way, are all members of old Memphis
families, being descendants of other squirrels and pigeons
which lived in this same place before the Civil War.
One might suppose that the pigeons, being able to fly up
to the seventeenth floor windowsills of the Merchants'
Exchange Building, where men of the grain and hay
bureau of the exchange are in the habit of leaving corn
for them, would prosper more than the squirrels, but
that is not the case for&mdash;and I regret to have to report
such immorality&mdash;the squirrels are in the habit of add<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>ing
to the stores of peanuts which are thrown to them,
by thievery. Like rascally urchins they will watch the
peanut venders, and when their backs are turned, will
make swift dashes at the peanut stands, seizing nuts
and scampering away again. Sometimes the venders
detect them, and give chase for a few steps, but that is
dangerous, for the minute the vender goes after one
squirrel, others rush up and steal more. It is saddening
to find that even squirrels are corrupted by metropolitan
life!</p>

</div>

<p>In reviewing my visit to Memphis I find myself, for
once, kindly disposed toward a Chamber of Commerce
and Business Men's Club. I like the Business Men's
Club because, besides issuing pamphlets shrieking the
glory of the city, it has found time to do things much
more worth while&mdash;notably to bring to Memphis some of
the great American orchestras.</p>

<p>A pamphlet issued by these organizations tells me that
Memphis is the largest cotton market in the country, the
largest hardwood producing market, the third largest
grocery and jobbing market.</p>

<p>Cotton is, indeed, much in evidence in the city. The
streets in some sections are full of strange little two-wheel
drays, upon which three bales are carried, and
which display, in combination, those three southern
things having such perfect artistic affinity: the negro,
the mule, and the cotton bale. The vast modern cotton
warehouses on the outskirts of the city cover many acres
of ground, and with their gravity system of distribution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
for cotton bales, and their hydraulic compresses in which
the bales are squeezed to minimum size, to the accompaniment
of negro chants, are exceedingly interesting.</p>

<p>The same pamphlet speaks also of the unusually large
proportion of the city's area which is given over
to parks and playgrounds, and it seems worth adding
that though Memphis follows the general southern custom
of barring negroes&mdash;excepting, of course, nursemaids
in charge of children&mdash;from her parks, she has
been so just as to provide a park for negroes only. In
this she stands ahead of most other southern cities.</p>

<p>Memphis has the only bridge crossing the Mississippi
below the mouth of the Ohio. At the time of our visit a
new bridge was being built very near the old one, and an
interesting experience of our trip was our visit to this
bridge, under the guidance of Mr. M.&nbsp;B. Case, a young
engineer in charge.</p>

<p>On a great undertaking, such as this one, where the
total cost mounts into millions, the first work done is not
on the proposed bridge itself, but on the plant and equipment
to be used in construction&mdash;derricks, barges, concrete-mixers,
air compressors for the caissons, small
engines, dump-cars and all manner of like things. This
preparatory work consumes some months. Caissons are
then sunk far down beneath the river bed. Caisson
work is dangerous, and the insurance rate on "sand
hogs"&mdash;the men who work in the caissons&mdash;is very high.
The scale of wages, and of time, varies in proportion to
the risk, which is according to the depth at which work is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
being done. On this enterprise, for example, men working
from mean level to a depth of 50 feet received $3 for
an eight-hour day. From 50 to 70 feet they worked but
six hours and received $3.75. From 90 to 105 feet they
worked in three shifts of one hour each, and received
$4.25. And while they were placing concrete to seal the
working chamber there was an additional allowance of
fifty cents a day.</p>

<p>The chief danger of caisson work is the "bends," or
"caisson disease." In the caisson a man works under
high air pressure. When he comes out, the pressure on
the fluids of the body is reduced, and this sometimes
causes the formation of a gas bubble in the vascular
system. If this bubble reaches a nerve-center it causes
severe pain, similar to neuralgia; if it gets to the brain
it causes paralysis. Day after day men will go into the
caisson and come out without trouble, but sooner or later
from 2 to 8 per cent. of caisson workers are affected.
Of 320 "sand-hogs" who labored in the caissons of this
bridge, three died of paralysis, and of course a number
of others had slight attacks of the "bends," in one form
or another.</p>

<p>The bridge, when we visited it, was more than half
completed. On the Memphis side the approaches were
almost ready, and the steel framework of the bridge
reached from the shore across the front pier, and was
being built out far beyond the pier, on the cantilever
principle, hanging in the air above the middle of the
stream. By walking out on the old bridge we could sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>vey
the extreme end of the new one, which was being
extended farther and farther, daily, by the addition of
new steel sections. There were then about 100 journeymen
bridgemen on the work&mdash;these being workmen of
the class that erects steel skyscraper frames&mdash;with some
fifty apprentices and carpenters, and about twenty common
laborers. Bridgemen are among the highest paid
of all workmen. In New York, at that time, their wage
was $6 for eight hours' work. Here it was $4.50.
Very few of the men had families with them in Memphis.
They are the soldiers of fortune among wage-earners,
a wild, reckless, fine looking lot of fellows, with
good complexions like those of men in training, and eyes
like the eyes of aviators. No class of men in the world,
I suppose, have steadier nerves, think quicker, or react
more rapidly from stimulus to action, whether through
sight or sound. They have to be like that. For where
other workmen pay for a mistake by loss of a job, these
men pay with life. Yet they will tell you that their
work is not dangerous. It is "just as safe as any other
kind of job"&mdash;that, although four of their number had
already been lost from this bridge alone. One went off
the end of the structure with a derrick, the boom of
which he lowered before the anchor-bolts had been
placed. Two others fell. A fourth was struck by a
falling timber.</p>

<span class="caption">Hanging in the air above the middle of the stream</span>
</div>

<p>Once, while we were watching the men scrambling
about upon the steel members of the uncompleted cantilever
arm, one of them thought something was about to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
fall, and ran swiftly in, over a steel beam, toward the
body of the structure; whereafter, as nothing did fall,
he was unmercifully twitted by his fellow workers for
having shown timidity.</p>

<p>Many of the men working on this bridge had worked
on the older structure paralleling it. This was true not
only of the laboring men, but of the engineers. Ralph
Modjeski, the consulting engineer at the head of the
work (he is, by the way, a son of Madame Modjeska),
was chief draughtsman when the earlier structure was
designed; W.&nbsp;E. Angier, assistant chief engineer in the
present work, was a field engineer on the first bridge, and
it is interesting to know that, in constructing the approach
to the old bridge he unearthed a Spanish halbert
which, it is thought, may date from the time of De Soto.
These bridge engineers and bridgebuilders move in a
large orbit. Their last job may have been in Mexico, in
the far West, or in India; their next may be in France.
Many of the men here, worked on the Blackwell's Island
bridge, on the Quebec bridge (which fell), on the
Thebes bridge over the Mississippi, twenty miles above
Cairo, on the Vancouver and Portland bridges over the
Columbia and Willamette rivers, and on the great Oregon
Trunk Railway bridges.</p>

<p>After standing for a time on the old bridge watching
work on the new, and shuddering, often enough, at the
squirrel-like way in which the men scampered about up
there, so far above the water, we walked in and moved
out again upon the partially completed floor of the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
bridge. Here it was necessary to walk on railroad ties,
with gaps, six or eight inches wide, between them.
Even had one tried, one could hardly have managed to
squeeze one's body through these chinks; to fall through
was impossible; nevertheless it gave me an uncomfortable
feeling in the region of the stomach to walk out
there, seeing the river all the time between the interstices.
When we had progressed for some distance we
came to a gap where, for perhaps a yard, there were no
ties&mdash;just open space, with the muddy water shining
cold and cruel below. The opening was only about as
wide as the hall of a small New York flat, and heaven
knows that to step across such a hall is easy enough.
But this was not so easy. When we came to the gap I
stopped. Mr. Case, the young engineer, who loved all
bridges with a sort of holy passion, and loved this bridge
in particular, was talking as we went along. I liked to
hear him talk. He had been telling us how a thing that
is to <i>be</i> strong ought to <i>look</i> strong, too, and from that
had got somehow to the topic of expansion and contraction
in bridges, with variations of temperature. "It
isn't only the steel bridges that do it," he said. "Stone
arch bridges do it, too. The crown of the arch rises and
falls. The Greeks and Romans and Egyptians knew
that expansion and contraction occurred. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>While talking he had gone across the gap, stepping
lightly upon a stringpiece probably a foot wide, and proceeding
over the ties. Now, however, he ceased speaking
and looked back, for I was no longer beside him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
At the gap I had stopped. I intended to step across, but
I did not propose to do so without giving the matter the
attention it seemed to me to deserve.</p>

<p>Mr. Case did not laugh at me. He came back and
stood on the string-piece where it crossed the opening,
telling me to put my hand on his shoulder. But I did
not want to do that. I wanted to cross alone&mdash;when I
got ready. It took me perhaps two minutes to get ready.
Then I stepped over. It was, of course, absurdly easy.
I had known it would be. But as we walked along I
kept thinking to myself: "I shall have to cross that
beastly place again when we come back," and I marveled
the more at the amazing steadiness of eye and mind and
nerve that enables some men to go continually prancing
about over emptiness infinitely more engulfing than that
which had troubled and was troubling me.</p>

<p>Returning I stepped across without physical hesitation.
But after I had crossed I continued to hate that
gap. I hated it as I drove back to the hotel, that afternoon,
as I ate dinner that night, as I went to bed, and in
my dreams I continued to cross it, and to see the river
waiting for me, seeming to look up and leer and beckon.
I woke up hating the gap in the bridge as much as ever;
I hated it down into the State of Mississippi, and over
into Georgia; and wherever I have gone since, I have
continued to hate it. Of course there isn't any gap there
now. It was covered long ago. Yet for me it still exists,
like some obnoxious person who, though actually
dead, lives on in the minds of those who knew him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

BEAUTIFUL SAVANNAH</h2>


<p>How often it occurs that the great work a man set
out originally to accomplish, is lost sight of, by
future generations, in contemplation of other
achievements of that man, which he himself regarded
as of secondary importance.</p>

<p>In 1733, the year in which General Oglethorpe started
his Georgia colony, there were more than a hundred offenses
for which a person might be hanged in England;
Oglethorpe's primary idea in founding the colony
was to provide a means of freeing debtors from prison,
and giving them a fresh start in life; yet it is as the man
responsible for the laying out of the beautiful city of
Savannah, that Oglethorpe is probably most widely remembered
to-day.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe was a first-rate soldier. He defeated a
superior Spanish force from Florida, and successfully
resisted attacks from the Indians. Also, he was a man
whose ethical sense was in advance of his period. He
did not permit slavery in Georgia, and it was not adopted
there until he went back to England. In planning
Savannah he was assisted by a Charleston engineer
named Bull, for whom the chief street of Savannah is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
named. The place is laid out very simply; it has rectangular
blocks and wide roads, with small parks, or
squares, at regular intervals. There are some two
dozen of these small parks, aside from one or two larger
parks, a parade ground, and numerous boulevards with
double roadways and parked centers, and the abundance
of semi-tropical foliage and of airy spaces, in Savannah,
gives the city its most distinctive and charming quality&mdash;the
quality which differentiates it from all other
American cities. Originally these parks were used as
market-places and rallying points in case of Indian attack;
now they serve the equally utilitarian purposes of
this age, having become charming public gardens and
playgrounds. One of them&mdash;not the most important
one&mdash;is named Oglethorpe Square; but the monument
to Oglethorpe is placed elsewhere.</p>

<span class="caption">These small parks give Savannah a quality which differentiates it from all other American cities</span>
</div>

<p>Madison Square, Savannah, is relatively about as
important as Madison Square, New York, and though
smaller than the latter, is much prettier. It contains
a monument to Sergeant Jasper, the Revolutionary hero
who, when the flag was shot down from Fort Moultrie,
off Charleston, by the British, flung it to the breeze
again, under fire. Jasper was later killed with the flag
in his arms, in the French-American attempt to take
Savannah from the British. Monterey Square has a
statue of Count Pulaski, who also fell at the siege of
Savannah. Another Revolutionary hero remembered
with a monument is General Nathanael Greene who,
though born in Rhode Island, moved after the war to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
Georgia where, in recognition of his services, he was
given an estate not far from Savannah. "Mad"
Anthony Wayne, a Pennsylvanian by birth, also accepted
an estate in Georgia and resided there after the
Revolution.</p>

<p>An interesting story attaches to Greene's settlement
in Georgia. The estate given to him was that known
as Mulberry Grove, above the city, on the Savannah
River. The property had previously belonged to Lieutenant-governor
John Graham, but was confiscated because
Graham was a loyalist. Along with the property,
Greene apparently took over the Graham vault in Colonial
Cemetery&mdash;now a city park, and a very interesting
one because of the old tombs and gravestones&mdash;and there
he was himself buried. After a while people forgot
where Greene's remains lay, and later, when it was
decided to erect a monument to his memory in Johnson
Square, they couldn't find any Greene to put under it.
However, they went ahead and made the monument,
and Lafayette laid the cornerstone, when he visited
Savannah in March, 1825. Greene's remains were lost
for 114 years. They did not come to light until 1902,
when some one thought of opening the Graham vault.
Thereupon they were removed and reinterred in their
proper resting place beneath the monument which had so
long awaited them. That monument, by the way, was
not erected by Savannah people, or even by Southerners,
but was paid for by the legislature of the general's native
Rhode Island. When the remains were discovered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
Rhode Island asked for them, but Savannah, which had
lost them, also wanted them. The matter was settled by
a vote of Greene's known descendants, who decided almost
unanimously to leave his remains in Savannah.</p>

<p>The foundation of the general's former home at Mulberry
Grove may still be seen. It was in this house that
Eli Whitney invented the cotton-gin. Whitney was a
tutor in the Greene family after the general's death,
and it was at the suggestion of Mrs. Greene that he
started to try and make "a machine to pick the seed out
of cotton." It is said that Whitney's first machine
would do, in five hours, work which, if done by hand,
would take one man two years. This was, of course, an
epoch-making invention and caused enormous commercial
growth in the South, where cotton-gins are as common
things as restaurants in the city of New York.
Which reminds me of a story.</p>

<p>A northern man was visiting Mr. W.&nbsp;D. Pender, at
Tarboro, North Carolina. On the day of the guest's
arrival Mr. Pender spoke to his cook, a negro woman of
the old order, telling her to hurry up the dinner, because
he wished to take his friend down to see the cotton-gin.
"You know," he explained, "this gentleman has never
seen a cotton-gin."</p>

<p>The cook looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Lor'! Mistuh Penduh," she exclaimed. "An' dat
man <i>look</i> like he was edjacated!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another item in Savannah history is that John Wes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>ley
came over about the middle of the eighteenth century
to convert the Indians to Christianity. It was
not until after this attempt, when he returned to
England, that he began the great religious movement
which led to the founding of the Methodist Church.
George Whitfield also preached in Savannah. Evidently
Wesley did not get very far with the savages
who, it may be imagined, were more responsive to the
kind of "conversion" attempted in South Carolina, by a
French dancing-master, who went out from Charleston
in the early days and taught them the steps of the stately
minuet.</p>

<p>Another great event in Savannah history was the departure
from that port, in 1819, of the <i>City of Savannah</i>,
the first steamship to cross the Atlantic. If I may
make a suggestion to the city, it is that the centennial
of this event be celebrated, and that a memorial be
erected. Inspiration for such a memorial might perhaps
be found in the simple and charming monument,
crowned by a galleon in bronze, which has been erected
in San Francisco, in memory of Robert Louis Stevenson.
A ship in bronze can be a glorious thing&mdash;which
is more than can be said of a bronze statesman in modern
pantaloons.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>More lately Savannah initiated another world-improvement:
she was the first city to abolish horses entirely
from her fire department, replacing them with
automobile engines, hook-and-ladders, and hose-carts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
That is in line with what one would expect of Savannah,
for she is not only a progressive city, but is a great
automobile city, having several times been the scene of
important international automobile road races, including
the Grand Prize and the Vanderbilt Cup.</p>

<p>Nor is there want of other history. The Savannah
Theater, though gutted by fire and rebuilt, is the same
theater that Joseph Jefferson owned and managed for
a time, in the fifties; in the house on Lafayette Square,
now occupied by Judge W.&nbsp;W. Lambdin, Robert E. Lee
once stayed, and Thackeray is said to have written there
a part of "The Virginians."</p>

<p>A sad thing was happening in Savannah when we
were there. The Habersham house, one of the loveliest
old mansions of the city, was being torn down to make
room for a municipal auditorium.</p>

<p>The first Habersham in America was a Royal Governor
of Georgia. He had three sons one of whom,
Joseph, had, by the outbreak of the Revolution, become a
good enough American to join a band of young patriots
who took prisoner the British governor, Sir James
Wright. The governor's house was situated where the
Telfair Academy now is. He was placed under parole,
but nevertheless fled to Bonaventure, the Tabnall estate,
not far from the city, where he was protected by friends
until he could escape to the British fleet, which then lay
off Tybee Island at the mouth of the Savannah River,
some eighteen miles below the city. This same Joseph
Habersham, it is said, led a party which went out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
1775 in skiffs&mdash;called <i>bateaux</i> along this part of the
coast&mdash;boarded the British ship <i>Hinchenbroke</i>, lying at
anchor in the river, and captured her in a hand-to-hand
conflict. Mr. Neyle Colquitt of Savannah, a descendant
of the Habershams, tells me that the powder taken from
the <i>Hinchenbroke</i> was used at the Battle of Bunker Hill.
After the war, in which Joseph Habersham commanded
a regiment of regulars, he was made Postmaster General
of the United States. The old house itself was built by
Archibald Bulloch, a progenitor of that Miss "Mittie"
Bulloch who later became Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.,
mother of the President. It was designed by an English
architect named Jay, who did a number of the fine
old houses of Savannah, which are almost without exception
of the Georgian period. Archibald Bulloch bought
the lot on which he built the house from Matthew
McAllister, great-grandfather of Ward McAllister.
When sold by Bulloch it passed through several hands
and finally came into the possession of Robert Habersham,
a son of Joseph.</p>

<p>The old house was spacious and its interiors had a
fine formality about them. The staircase, fireplace and
chandeliers were handsome, and there was at the rear
a charming oval room, the heavy mahogany doors of
which were curved to conform to the shape of the walls.
To tear down such a house was sacrilege&mdash;also it was a
sacrilege hard to commit, for some of the basement walls
were fifteen feet thick, and of solid brick straight
through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p>Sherman's headquarters were on the Square, just
south of the De Soto Hotel, in the battlemented brick
mansion which is the residence of General Peter W.
Meldrim, ex-president of the American Bar Association,
and former Mayor of Savannah.</p>

<p>Among other old houses characteristic of Savannah,
are the Scarborough house, the Mackay house, the
Thomas house in Franklin Square (also known as
the Owens house), in which Lafayette was entertained,
and the Telfair house, now the Telfair Academy.
The Telfair and Thomas houses were built by the architect
who built the Habersham house, and it is to be
hoped that they will never go the way of the latter
mansion.</p>

<span class="caption">The Thomas House in Franklin Square in which Lafayette was entertained</span>
</div>

<p>In 1810, about the time these houses were built,
Savannah had 5,000 inhabitants; by 1850 the population
had trebled, and 1890 found it a place of more
than 40,000. Since then the city has grown with
wholesome rapidity, and attractive suburban districts
have been developed. The 1910 census gives the population
as 65,000, but the city talks exuberantly of 90,000.
Well, perhaps that is not an exaggerated claim. Certainly
it is a city to attract those who are free to live
where they please. In fall, winter and spring it leaves
little to be desired. I have been there three times, and I
have never walked up Bull Street without looking forward
to the day when I could go there, rent an old house
full of beautiful mahogany, and pass a winter. Not
even New Orleans made me feel like that. I feel about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
New Orleans that it is a place to visit rather than to
settle down in. I want to go back to New Orleans, but
I do not want to stay more than a few weeks. I want
to see some people that I know, prowl about the French
quarter, and have Jules Alciatore turn me out a dinner;
then I want to go away. So, too, I want to go back to
Atlanta&mdash;just to see some people. I want to stay there
a week or two. Also I want to go to St. Augustine
when cold weather comes, and bask in the warm sun, and
breathe the soft air full of gold dust, and feel indolent
and happy as I watch the activities about the excellent
Ponce de Leon Hotel; but there are two cities in the
South that I dream of going to for a quiet happy winter
of domesticity and work, in a rented house&mdash;it must be
the right house, too&mdash;and those cities are, first Charleston;
then Savannah.</p>

<p>The Telfair Academy in the old Telfair mansion was
left, by a member of the family, to the city, to be used
as a museum. Being somewhat skeptical about museums
in cities of the size of Savannah, not to say
much larger cities, especially when they are art museums,
I very nearly omitted a visit to this one. Had I done
so I would have missed seeing not only a number of exceedingly
interesting historic treasures, but what I believe
to be the best public art collection contained in any
southern city.</p>

<p>The museum does, to be sure, contain a number of
old "tight" paintings of the kind with which the country
was deluged at the time of the Chicago World's Fair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
but upstairs there is a surprise in shape of an exhibition
of modern American paintings (the best paintings being
produced in the world to-day) showing brilliant
selection. I was utterly amazed when I found this collection.
There were excellent canvases by Childe Hassam,
Ernest Lawson, George Bellows, and other living
American painters whose work, while it is becoming
more and more widely appreciated each year, is still
beyond all but the most advanced and discriminating
buyers of paintings. I went into ecstasies over this collection,
and I said to myself: "Away down here in Savannah
there is some one buying better paintings for a
little museum than the heads of many of the big
museums in the country have had sense enough or
courage enough to buy. This man ought to be 'discovered'
and taken to some big museum where his appreciation
will be put to the greatest use." With that I
rushed downstairs, sought out the curator, and asked
who had purchased the modern American pictures.
And then my bubble was pricked, for who had they had,
down there, buying their pictures for them, but Gari
Melchers! Naturally the pictures were good!</p>

<p>In one room of the building, on the ground floor, is
a collection of fine old furniture, etc., which belonged
to the Telfair family, including two beautiful mantelpieces
of black and white marble, some cabinets, and a
very curious and fascinating extension dining-table,
built of mahogany. The table is perfectly round, and
the leaves, instead of being added in the middle, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
curved pieces, fitting around the outer edge in two series,
so that when extended to its full capacity the
table is still round. I have never seen another such
table.</p>

<p>Also I found many interesting old books and papers
passed down from the Telfairs. One of these was a
ledger with records of slave sales.</p>

<p>In a sale held Friday, October 14, 1774, Sir James
Wright, the same British governor who was presently
put to flight, purchased four men, five women, nine boys,
and one girl, at a total cost of &pound;820, or about $3,280.
Sir Patrick Houston bought two women at &pound;90, or $450.
The whole day's sale disposed of thirty-five men, seventeen
women, twenty-seven boys and ten girls, at a grand
total of &pound;3206, or roughly between nine and ten thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The Telfairs were great planters. Among the papers
was one headed "Rules and Directions to be strictly attended
to by all overseers at Thorn Island Plantation."
This plantation was on the North Carolina side of the
river, and was owned by Alexander Telfair, a brother
of Miss Mary Telfair who gave the Academy to the city.
Dates which occur in the papers stamp them as having
been issued some time prior to 1837. Here are some of
the regulations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The allowance for every grown negro, let him or her
be old and good for nothing, and every young one that
works in the field, is a peck of corn a week and a pint of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
salt and a piece of meat not exceeding fourteen pounds
per month.</p>

<p>No negro to have more than forty lashes, no matter
what his crime.</p>

<p>The suckling children and all small ones who do not
work in the field draw a half allowance of corn and salt.</p>

<p>Any negro can have a ticket to go about the neighborhood,
but cannot leave it without a pass. No strangers
allowed to come on the place without a pass.</p>

<p>The negroes to be tasked when the work allows it. I
require a reasonable day's work well done. The task to
be regulated by the state of the ground and the strength
of the negro.</p>

<p>All visiting between the Georgia plantation to be refused.
[The Telfairs owned another plantation on the
Georgia side of the river.] No one to get husbands or
wives across the river. No night meeting or preaching
allowed on the place except on Saturday or Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>If there is any fighting on the place whip all engaged
in it, no matter what may be the cause it may be covered
with.</p>

<p>In extreme cases of sickness employ a physician.
After a dose of castor oil is given, a dose of calomel, and
blister applied, if no relief, then send.</p>

<p>My negroes are not allowed to plant cotton for themselves.
Everything else they may plant. Give them
ticket to sell what they make.</p>

<p>I have no Driver (slave-driver). You are to task the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
negroes yourself. They are responsible to you alone for
work.</p>
</div>

<p>Certain negroes are mentioned by name:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Many persons are indebted to Elsey for attending
upon their negroes. I wish you to see them or send to
them for the money.</p>

<p>If Dolly is unable to return to cooking she must take
charge of all the little negroes.</p>

<p>Pay Free Moses two dollars and a half for taking care
of things left at his landing.</p>
</div>

<p>Bull Street, the fashionable street of the city, is a gem
of a street, despite the incursions made at not infrequent
intervals, by comparatively new, and often very ugly
buildings. Every few blocks Bull Street has to turn
out of its course and make the circuit of one of the small
parks of which I have spoken, and this gives it charm
and variety. On this street stands the De Soto Hotel,
which, when I first went to Savannah, years ago, was by
all odds the leading hostelry of the city. It is one of
those great rambling buildings with a big porch out in
front, an open court in back, and everything about it, including
the bedchambers, very spacious and rather old
fashioned. Lately the Savannah Hotel has been erected
down at the business end of Bull Street. It is a modern
hotel of the more conventional commercial type. But
even down there, near the business part of town, it is not
confronted by congested cobbled streets and clanging
trolley cars, but looks out upon one of the squares, filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
with magnolias, oaks and palms. But another time I
think I shall go back to the De Soto.</p>

<p>The building of the Independent Presbyterian Church,
on Bull Street, is one of the most beautiful of its kind in
the country, inside and out. It reminds one of the old
churches in Charleston, and it is gratifying to know that
though the old church which stood on this site (dedicated
in 1819) burned in 1889, the congregation did not
seize the opportunity to replace it with a hideosity in
lemon-yellow brick, but had the rare good sense to duplicate
the old church exactly, with the result that, though a
new building, it has all the dignity and simple beauty of
an old one.</p>

<p>Broughton Street, the shopping street, crosses Bull
Street in the downtown section, and looks ashamed of
itself as it does so, for it is about as commonplace a looking
street as one may see. There is simply nothing about
it of distinction save its rather handsome name.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, however, there are several skyscrapers,
most of them good looking buildings. It seemed to me
also that I had never seen so many banks as in Savannah,
and I am told that it is, indeed, a great banking
city, and that the record of the Savannah banks
for weathering financial storms is very fine. On a good
many corners where there are not banks there are clubs,
and some of these clubs are delightful and thoroughly
metropolitan in character. I know of no city in the
North, having a population corresponding to that of
Charleston or of Savannah, which has clubs comparable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
with the best clubs of these cities, or of New Orleans.
When it is considered that of the population of these
southern cities approximately one half, representing
negroes, must be deducted in considering the population
from which eligibles must be drawn, the excellence of
southern clubs becomes remarkable in the extreme.
Savannah, by the way, holds one national record in the
matter of clubs. It had the first golf club founded in
America. Exactly when the club was founded I cannot
say, but Mr. H.&nbsp;H. Bruen, of Savannah, has in his
possession an invitation to a golf club ball held in the
old City Hall in the year 1811.</p>

<p>The commercial ascendancy of Savannah over
Charleston is due largely to natural causes. The port of
Savannah drains exports from a larger and richer territory
than is tapped by Charleston, though new railroads
are greatly improving Charleston's situation in
this respect. Savannah is a shipping port for cotton
from a vast part of the lower and central South, and is
also a great port for lumber, and the greatest port in the
world for "naval stores." I did not know what naval
stores were when I went to Savannah. The term conjured
up in my mind pictures of piles of rope, pulleys
and anchors. But those are not naval stores. Naval
stores are gum products, such as resin and turpentine,
which are obtained from the long-leafed pines of South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida. The traveler
through these States cannot have failed to notice gashes
on the tree-trunks along the way. From these the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
resinous sap exudes and is caught in cups, after which
it is boiled, there in the woods, and thus separated into
turpentine, resin and pitch. Vast quantities of these
materials are stored on the great modern docks of Savannah.
It is said that owing to wasteful methods, the
long-leafed pine forests are being rapidly destroyed, and
that this industry will die out before very long because
the eager grabbers of to-day's dollars, having no thought
for the future, fail to practise scientific forestry.</p>

<p>All about Savannah, within easy reach by trolley,
motor or boat, lie pleasant retreats and interesting things
to see. The roads of the region, built by convict labor,
are of the finest, and the convict prison camps are worth
a visit. In the Brown Farm camp, living conditions are
certainly more sanitary than in ninety nine out of a hundred
negro homes. The place fairly shines with cleanliness,
and there are many cases in which "regulars" at
this camp are no sooner released than they offend again
with the deliberate purpose of carrying out what may be
termed a "back to the farm" movement. The color line
is drawn in southern jails and convict camps as elsewhere.
White prisoners occupy one barracks; negroes
another. The food and accommodations for both is the
same. The only race discrimination I could discover
was that when white prisoners are punished by flogging,
they are flogged with their clothes on, whereas, with
negroes, the back is exposed. The men in this camp are
minor offenders and wear khaki overalls in place of the
stripes in which the worse criminals, quartered in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>other
camp, are dressed. Strict discipline is maintained,
but the life is wholesome. The men are marched to
work in the morning and back at night escorted by
guards who carry loaded shotguns, and who always have
with them a pack of ugly bloodhounds to be used in case
escape is attempted.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>All the drives in this region are extremely picturesque,
for the live-oak grows here at its best, and is to be
seen everywhere, its trunk often twenty or more feet in
circumference, its wide-spreading branches reaching
out their tips to meet those of other trees of the same
species, so that sometimes the whole world seems to have
a groined ceiling of foliage, a ceiling which inevitably
suggests a great shadowy cathedral from whose airy
arches hang long gray pennons of Spanish moss, like
faded, tattered battle-flags.</p>

<p>On country roads you will come, now and then, upon
a negro burial ground of very curious character. There
may be such negro cemeteries in the upper Southern
States, but if so I have never seen them. In this portion
of Georgia they are numerous, and their distinguishing
mark consists in the little piles of household
effects with which every grave is covered. I do not
know whether this is done to propitiate ghosts and devils
(generally believed to "hant" these graveyards), or
whether it is the idea that the deceased can still find use
for the assortment of pitchers, bowls, cups, saucers,
knives, forks, spoons, statuettes, alarm-clocks, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
heaven only knows what else, which were his treasured
earthly possessions.</p>

<p>In Savannah, I have heard Commodore Tatnall, who
used to live at Bonaventure, credited with having originated
the saying "Blood is thicker than water," but I am
inclined to believe that the Commodore merely made apposite
use of an old formula. The story is told of
one of the old Tatnalls that in the midst of a large
dinner-party which he was giving at his mansion
at Bonaventure plantation, a servant entered and informed
him that the house was on fire. Whereupon the
old thoroughbred, instead of turning fireman, persisted
in his r&ocirc;le of host, ordering the full dining-room equipment
to be moved out upon the lawn, where the company
remained at dinner while the house burned down.</p>

<p>Most of the old houses of the plantations on the river
have long since been destroyed. That at Whitehall
was burned by the negroes when Sherman's army came
by, but the old trees and gardens still endure, including a
tall hedge of holly which is remarkable even in this
florescent region. The old plantation house at the
Hermitage, approached by a handsome avenue of live-oaks,
is, I believe, the only one of those ancient mansions
which still stands, and it does not stand very strongly,
for, beautiful though it is in its abandonment and decay,
it is like some noble old gentleman dying alone in an
attic, of age, poverty and starvation&mdash;dying proudly
as poor Charles Gayarr&eacute; did in New Orleans.</p>

<p>The Hermitage has, I believe, no great history save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
what is written in its old chipped walls of stucco-covered
brick, and the slave-cabins which still form a background
for it. It is a story of baronial decay, resulting, doubtless,
from the termination of slavery. Hordes of negroes
of the "new issue" infest the old slave-cabins and
on sight of visitors rush out with almost violent demands
for money, in return for which they wish to sing. Their
singing is, however, the poorest negro singing I have
ever heard. All the spontaneity, all the relish, all the
vividness which makes negro singing wonderful, has
been removed, here, by the fixed idea that singing is not
a form of expression but a mere noise to be given vent
to for the purpose of extracting backsheesh. It is
saddening to witness the degradation, through what may
be called professionalism, of any great racial quality.
These negroes, half mendicant, half traders on the reputation
of their race, express professionalism in its lowest
form. They are more pitiful than the professional
tarantella dancers who await the arrival of tourists, in
certain parts of southern Italy, as spiders await flies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the boast of Jacksonville (known locally by the
convenient abbreviation "Jax") that it stands as the
"Gate to Florida." But the fact that a gate is something
through which people pass&mdash;usually without stopping&mdash;causes
some anguish to an active Chamber of
Commerce, which has been known to send bands to the
railway station to serenade tourists in the hope of enticing
them to alight.</p>

<p>If I were to personify Jacksonville, it would be, I
think, as an amiable young woman, member of a domestic
family, whose papa and mama had moved to
Florida from somewhere else&mdash;for it is as hard to find a
native of Jacksonville in that city as to find a native New
Yorker in New York. Miss Jacksonville's papa, as I
conceive it, has prospered while daughter has been
growing up, and has bought for her a fine large house on
a main corner, where many people pass. Having
reached maturity Miss Jacksonville wishes to be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
Florida society&mdash;to give, as it were, house parties, like
those of her neighbors, the other winter resorts. She
sees people passing her doors all winter long, and she
says to herself: "I must get some of these people to
come in."</p>

<p>To this end she brushes off the walk, lays a carpet on
the steps, puts flowers in the vases, orders up a lot of
fancy food and drink (from the very admirable Hotel
Mason), turns on the lights and the Victor, leaves the
front door invitingly open, and hopes for the best.
Soon people begin to come in, but as she meets them she
discovers that most of them have come to see papa on
business; only a few have come on her account. They
help themselves to sandwiches, look about the room, and
listen to what Miss Jacksonville has to say.</p>

<p>Time passes. Nothing happens. She asks how they
like the chairs.</p>

<p>"Very comfortable," they assure her.</p>

<p>"Do have some more to eat and drink," says she.</p>

<p>"What is your history?" a guest asks her presently.</p>

<p>"I haven't much history to speak of," she replies.
"They tell me Andrew Jackson had his territorial government
about where my house stands, but I don't
know much about it. We don't care much about history
in our family."</p>

<p>"What do you do with yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I keep house, and go occasionally to the Woman's
Club, and in the evenings father tells me about his business."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very nice," says one guest, whom we shall picture as
a desirable and wealthy young man from the North.
"Now let's do something. Do you play or sing? Are
you athletic? Do you go boating on the St. John's
River? Do you gamble? Can you make love?"</p>

<p>"I dance a little and play a little golf out at the
Florida Country Club," she says, with but small signs of
enthusiasm. "The thing I'm really most interested in,
though, is father's business. He lost a lot of money in
the fire of 1901, but he's made it all back and a lot more
besides."</p>

<p>"What about surf-bathing?" asks the pleasure-seeking
visitor, stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>"There's Atlantic Beach only eighteen miles from
here. It's a wonderful beach. Father's putting a million
in improvements out there, but there's no time to
go there just now. However, if you'd like to, I can
take you down and show you the new docks he has
built."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thanks," says the guest. "I don't care for
docks&mdash;not, that is, unless we can go boating."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we can't do that," says Miss Jacksonville.
"We don't use the river much for pleasure. I
can't say just why, unless it is that every one is
too busy.... But please eat something more, and
do have something to drink. There's plenty for every
one."</p>

<p>"I must be running along," says the visitor. "I've
been invited to call at some other houses down the block.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
By the way, what is the name of your neighbor next
door?"</p>

<p>"St. Augustine," says Jacksonville, with a little reluctance.
"She is of Spanish descent and sets great
store by it. If you call there she'll show you a lot of
interesting old relics she has, but I assure you that when
it comes to commercial success her family isn't one-two-three
with papa."</p>

<p>"Thanks," says the visitor, "but just at the moment
commerce doesn't appeal to me. Who lives beyond
her?"</p>

<p>Miss Jacksonville sighs. "There are some pleasant,
rather attractive people named Ormonde, beyond," she
says, "and a lively family named Daytona next door to
them. Neither family is in business, like papa. They
just play all the time. Then come a number of modest
places, and after them, in the big yellow and white
house with the palm trees all around it&mdash;but I'd advise
you to keep away from there! Yes, you'd better go
by that house. On the other side of it, in another lovely
house, live some nicer, simpler people named Miami.
Or if you like fishing, you might drop in on Mrs. Long-Key&mdash;she's
wholesome and sweet, and goes out every
day to catch tarpon. Or, again, you might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the people in the big yellow
and white house surrounded by palm trees? Why
shouldn't I go there?" asks the guest.</p>

<p>"A young widow lives there," says Miss Jacksonville
primly. "I don't know much about her history, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
she looks to me as though she had been on the stage.
She's frightfully frivolous&mdash;not at all one of our representative
people."</p>

<p>"Ah!" says the visitor. "Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Well," admits Miss Jacksonville, "I suppose she <i>is</i>&mdash;in
a fast way. But she's all rouged and she overdresses.
Her bathing suits are too short at the bottom
and her evening gowns are too short at the top. Yes,
and even at that, she has a trick of letting the shoulder
straps slip off and pretending she doesn't know it has
happened."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Palm-Beach."</p>

<p>"Oh," says the visitor. "I've heard of her. She's
always getting into the papers. Tell me more."</p>

<p>Miss Jacksonville purses her lips and raises her eyebrows.
"Really," she says, "I don't like to talk
scandal."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! Do!" pleads the visitor. "Is she bad&mdash;bad
and beautiful and alluring?"</p>

<p>"Judge for yourself," says Miss Jacksonville sharply.
"She keeps that enormous place of hers shut up except
for about two months or so in the winter, when she
comes down gorgeously dressed, with more jewelry than
is worn by the rest of the neighborhood put together.
Few Southerners go to her house. It's full of rich
people from all over the North."</p>

<p>"Is she rich?"</p>

<p>"You'd think so to look at her&mdash;especially if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
didn't know where she got her money. But she really
hasn't much of her own. She's a grafter."</p>

<p>"How does she manage it?"</p>

<p>"Men give her money."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because she knows how to please the rich. She understands
them. She makes herself beautiful for them.
She plays, and drinks, and gambles, and dances with
them, and goes riding with them in wheel chairs by
moonlight, and sits with them by the sea, and holds their
hands, and gets them sentimental. There's some scent
she uses that is very seductive&mdash;none of the rest of us
have been able to find out exactly what it is."</p>

<p>"But how does she get their money?"</p>

<p>"She never tells a hard-luck story&mdash;you can't get
money out of the kind she goes with, that way. She
takes the other tack. She whispers to them, and laughs
with them, and fondles them, and makes them love her,
and when they love her she says: 'But dearie, be reasonable!
Think how many people love me! I like to
have you here, you fat old darling with the gold jingling
in your pockets! but I can't let you sit with me
unless you pay. Yes, I'm expensive, I admit. But
don't you love this scent I wear? Don't you adore my
tropical winter sea, my gardens, my palm trees, my
moonlight, and my music? They are all for you, dearie&mdash;so
why shouldn't you pay? Don't I take you from
the northern cold and slush? Haven't I built a siding
for your private car, and made an anchorage for your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
yacht? Don't I let you do as you please? Don't I keep
you amused? Don't you love to look at me? Don't I
put my warm red lips to yours? Well, then, dearie,
what is all your money for?' ... That is her way of
talking to them! That is the sort of creature that she
is!"</p>

<p>"Shocking!" says the visitor, rising and looking for
his hat "You say hers is the third large house from
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Remember, she's as mercenary as can be!"</p>

<p>"Thanks. I can take care of myself. If she's amusing
that suits me. Good-by."</p>

<p>In the vestibule he pauses to count his money.</p>

<p>"Jacksonville seems to be a nice girl," he says to himself
as he hastens down the block. "I imagine she might
make a good wife and mother, and that she'd help her
husband on in business. However, I'm not thinking of
getting married and settling down in Florida. I'm
out for some fun. I think I'll run in and call upon
Mrs. Palm-Beach."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p>

<p>Like all places in which idlers try to avoid finding
out that they are idle, Palm Beach has very definite
customs as to where to go, and at what time
to go there. Excepting in its hours for going to bed
and getting up, it runs on schedule. The official day begins
with the bathing hour&mdash;half past eleven to half
past twelve&mdash;when the two or three thousand people
from the pair of vast hotels assemble before the casino
on the beach. Golfers will, of course, be upon the links
before this hour; fishermen will be casting from the pier
or will be out in boats searching the sail fish&mdash;that being
the "fashionable" fish at the present time; ladies of excessive
circumference will be panting rapidly along the
walks, their eyes holding that look of dreamy determination
which painters put into the eyes of martyrs, and
which a fixed intention to lose twenty pounds puts into
the eyes of banting women. So, too, certain gentlemen
of swarthy skin make their way to the casino sun parlor,
where they disrobe and bake until the bathing hour.
The object of this practice is to acquire, as nearly as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
white man may, the complexion of a mulatto, and it is
surprising to see how closely the skins of some more
ardent members of the "Browning Club," as this group
is called, match those of their chair boys. The underlying
theory of the "Browning Club" is that a triple-plated
coat of tan, taken north in March, advertises the
wearer as having been at Palm Beach during the entire
winter, thus establishing him as a man not merely of
means, but of great endurance.</p>

<p>The women of Palm Beach seem to be divided into
two distinct schools of thought on the subject of tanning.
While none of them compete with the radicals of the
"Browning Club," one may nevertheless observe that, in
evening dress, many young ladies reveal upon their
necks, shoulders, and arms, stenciled outlines of the
upper margins of their bathing suits. Ladies of the
opposing school, upon the contrary, guard the whiteness
of their skins as jealously as the men of the "Browning
Club" guard their blackness. Rather than be touched
with tan, many ladies of the latter group deny themselves
the pleasures of the surf. The parasols beneath
which they arrive upon the sands are not lowered until
they are safely seated beneath the green and blue striped
canvas tops of their beach chairs, and it may be observed
that even then they are additionally fortified
against the light, by wide black hats and thick dark veils
draped to mask their faces up to the eyes; "harem"
veils, they call them&mdash;the name, however, signifying
nothing polygamous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p>A pleasant diversion at the beginning of the bathing
hour occurs when some mere one-horse millionaire from
a Middle-Western town appears on the beach with his
family. He is newly arrived and is under the fond delusion
that he is as good as anybody else and that his
money is as good as any other person's money. Seeing
the inviting rows of beach chairs, he and his family
plump into several of them. They are hardly settled,
however, when the man who attends to the beach chairs
comes and asks them to get out, saying that the chairs
are reserved.</p>

<p>The other thinks the man is lying like a head waiter,
and demands to know for whom the chairs are reserved.</p>

<p>In reply the beach-chair man mentions, with suitable
deference, the name of Mrs. Hopkinson Skipkinson
Jumpkinson-Jones.</p>

<p>"Well," cries the Middle-Westerner, "Mrs. Jones
isn't here yet, is she? She can't use the chairs <i>now</i>, can
she, if she isn't here?"</p>

<p>Even without this evidence that he does not grasp at
all, the seriousness of the beach-chair situation, the fact
that the uncouth stranger has referred to Mrs. H.&nbsp;S.
Jumpkinson-Jones merely as "Mrs. Jones," brands him
among the Palm Beach "regulars" who have overheard
him, as a barbarian of the barbarians. People in neighboring
chairs at once turn their backs upon him and
glance at each other knowingly with raised eyebrows.
At this juncture, let us hope, the daughter of the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>truder
manages to pry him loose; let us hope also that
she takes him aside and tells him what everybody ought
to know: namely, that Mrs. H.&nbsp;S. Jumpkinson-Jones has
been a society leader ever since the "Journal" published
the full-page Sunday story about her having gold fillings
put in her Boston terrier's teeth. That was away
back in 1913, just before she was allowed to get her
divorce from Royal Tewksbury Johnson III of Paris,
Newport, and New York. The day after the divorce
she married her present husband, and up to last year,
when the respective wives of a munitions millionaire
and a moving-picture millionaire began to cut in on her,
no one thought of denying her claim to be the most
wasteful woman in Palm Beach.</p>

<p>True, she may not come down to the beach to-day, but
in that case it is obviously proper that her chairs&mdash;including
those of her dog and her husband&mdash;remain magnificently
vacant throughout the bathing hour.</p>

<p>The lady is, however, likely to appear. She will be
wearing one of the seventy hats which, we have learned
by the papers, she brought with her, and a pint or so of
her lesser pearls. Her dog&mdash;which is sometimes served
beside her at table at the Beach Club, and whose diet
is the same as her own, even to strawberries and cream
followed by a demi tasse&mdash;will be in attendance; and her
husband, whose diet is even richer, may also appear if
he has recovered from his matutinal headache. Here
she will sit through the hour, gossiping with her friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
watching the antics of several beautiful, dubious women,
camp followers of the rich, who add undoubted interest
to the place; calling languidly to her dog: "<i>Viens, Tou-tou!
Viens vite!</i>" above all waiting patiently, with
crossed knees, for news-service photographers to come
and take her picture&mdash;a picture which, when we see it
presently in "Vogue," "Vanity Fair," or a Sunday newspaper,
will present indisputable proof that Mrs. H.&nbsp;S.
Jumpkinson-Jones and the ladies sitting near her (also
with legs crossed) refrained from wearing bathing suits
neither through excessive modesty nor for fear of revealing
deformity of limb.</p>

<p>Many a Mrs. H.&nbsp;S. Jumpkinson-Jones has beaten her
way to glory by the Palm Beach route. Many of the
names which sound vaguely familiar when you read
them in connection with the story of a jewel robbery, in
lists of "those present," or in an insinuating paragraph
in the tattered copy of "Town Topics" which you pick
up, in lieu of reading matter, from the table in your dentist's
waiting room, first broke into the paradise of the
society column by way of this resort. For a woman
with money and the press-agent type of mind it is not a
difficult thing to accomplish. One must think of sensational
things to do&mdash;invent a new fad in dress, or send
one's dog riding each day in a special wheel chair, or
bring down one's own private dancing instructor or golf
instructor at $5,000 for the season. Above all, one must
be nice to the correspondents of newspapers. Never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
must one forget to do that. Never must one imagine
oneself so securely placed in society columns that one
may forget the reporters who gave one that place.</p>

<p>One lady who, for several seasons, figured extensively
in the news from Palm Beach, fell into this error. She
thought herself safe, and altered her manner toward
newspaper folk. But, alas! thereupon they altered their
manner toward her. The press clippings sent by the
bureau to which she subscribed became fewer and fewer.
Her sensational feats went unnoticed. At last came a
ball&mdash;one of the three big balls of the season; a New
York paper printed a list of names of persons who went
to the ball; a column of names in very small type. Lying
in bed a few mornings later she read through the names
and came to the end without finding her own. Thinking
that she must have skipped it, she read the names over
again with great care. Then she sent for her husband,
and he read them. When it was clear to them both that
her name was actually not there, it is said she went into
hysterics. At all events, her husband came down in a
rage and complained to the hotel management. But
what could the management do? What can they do?
The woman is doomed. The Palm Beach correspondents
who "made" her have been snubbed by her and have
unanimously declared "thumbs down." It is theirs to
give, but let no climber be unmindful of the fact that it
is also theirs to take away!</p>

<p>As Mrs. H.&nbsp;S. Jumpkinson-Jones looks over the top
of her harem veil she may see a great glistening steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
yacht, with rakish masts and funnel, lying off the pier-head;
and down on the sand she may see the young master
and mistress of that yacht: a modest, attractive pair,
possessors of one of the world's great fortunes, yet not
nearly so elaborately dressed, nor so insistent upon their
"position," as the Jumpkinson-Joneses. By raising the
brim of her hat a trifle Mrs. H.&nbsp;S. Jumpkinson-Jones
may see, sweeping in glorious circles above the yacht,
the hydroplane which, when it left the edge of the beach
a few minutes since, blew back with its propeller a stinging
storm of sand, and caused skirts to snap like flags
in a hundred-mile-an-hour hurricane; and in that hydroplane
she knows there is another multimillionaire.</p>

<p>Near by, sitting disconsolately upon the sand, are the
one-horse Middle-Western millionaire with his wife and
daughter&mdash;the three who were ousted from her seats
by the beach-chair man. Mrs. H.&nbsp;S. Jumpkinson-Jones,
like every one who has spent a season, let alone half a
dozen seasons, at Palm Beach, immediately recognizes
the type.</p>

<p>Father is the leading merchant of his town; mother
the social arbiter; daughter the regnant belle. Father
definitely didn't wish to come here, nor was mother
anxious to, but daughter made them. Often she has
read the lists of prominent arrivals at Palm Beach and
seen alluring pictures of them taken on the sand. She
has dreamed of the place, and in her dreams has seemed
to hear the call of Destiny. Who knows? may it not be
at Palm Beach that she will meet <i>him</i>?&mdash;the beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
and wealthy scion of a noble house who (so the fortune
teller at the Elks' Club bazaar told her) will rescue
her from the narrow life at home, and transport her, as
his bride, into a world of wonder and delight, and footmen
in knee-breeches. Daughter insisted on Palm
Beach. So mother got a lot of pretty clothes for daughter,
and father purchased several yards of green and
yellow railroad tickets, and off they went. They arrived
at Palm Beach. They walked the miles of green
carpeted corridor. They were dazed&mdash;as every one
must be who sees them for the first time&mdash;at the stunning
size of the hotels. They looked upon the endless
promenade of other visitors. They went to the beach
at bathing hour, to the cocoanut grove at the time for
tea and dancing, in wheel chairs through the jungle
trail and <i>Reve d'Et&eacute;</i>, to the waiters' cake walk in the
Poinciana dining room, to the concert at the Breakers,
to the palm room, and to the sea by moonlight; everywhere
they went they saw people, people, people: richly
dressed people, gay people, people who knew quantities
of other people; yet among them all was not one single
being that they had ever seen before. After several
days of this, father met a man he knew&mdash;a business
friend from Akron. A precious lot of good that did!
Why didn't father know the two young men who sat
last night at the next table in the dining room? Even
those two would have done just now. Clearly they had
been mad to know her too, for they were likewise feeling
desolate. Perhaps mother can get father to scrape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
up an acquaintance with them. But alas, before this
plan can be set in motion, the two young men have
formed their own conclusions as to what Palm Beach
is like when you do not know anybody in the place.
They have departed. Next day, when mother enters
daughter's room to say good night, she finds her weeping;
and next day, to father's infinite relief, they start
for home. So it has gone with many a bush-league
belle.</p>

<p>Even the Mrs. Jumpkinson-Joneses, satiated though
they be with private cars, press notices, and Palm
Beach, can hardly fail to be sensible to the almost delirious
beauty of the scene at bathing hour.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the sand more like a deep, warm dust of
yellow gold; nowhere is there a margin of the earth so
splashed with spots of brilliant color: sweaters, parasols,
bathing suits, canvas shelters&mdash;blue, green, purple, pink,
yellow, orange, scarlet&mdash;vibrating together in the sharp
sunlight like brush marks on a high-keyed canvas by
Sorolla; nowhere has flesh such living, glittering beauty
as the flesh of long, white, lovely arms which flash out,
cold and dripping, from the sea; nowhere does water appear
less like water, more like a flowing waste of liquid
emeralds and sapphires, held perpetually in cool solution
and edged with a thousand gleaming, flouncing strings
of pearls.</p>

</div>

<p>Over the beach lies a layer of people, formed in
groups, some of them costumed for the water, some for
the shore; some of them known to the great lady, many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
of them unknown to her. The groups are forever shifting
as their members rise and run down to the sea, or
come back shiny and dripping, to fling themselves again
upon the warm sand, roll in it, or stretch out in lazy comfort
while their friends shovel it over them with their
hands. Now one group, or another, will rise and form a
grinning row while a snap-shot is taken; now they recline
again; now they scamper down to see the hydroplane
come in; now they return, drop to the sand, and
idly watch women bathers tripping past them toward the
water. Here comes a girl in silken knickerbockers, with
cuffs buttoning over her stockings like the cuffs of riding
breeches. Heads turn simultaneously as she goes by.
Here is a tomboy in a jockey cap; here two women
wearing over their bathing suits brilliant colored satin
wraps which flutter revealingly in the warm, fresh fragrant
breeze. And now comes the slender, aristocratic,
foreign-looking beauty who wears high-heeled slippers
with her bathing costume, and steps gracefully to the
water's edge under the shade of a bright colored Japanese
parasol. It seems that every one must now be on
the beach. But no! Here come the three most wonderful
of all: the three most watched, most talked about,
most spoiled, most coveted young women at Palm Beach.
Their bathing suits are charming: very short, high
waisted, and cut at the top like Empire evening gowns,
showing lovely arms and shoulders. Hovering about
them, like flies about a box of sweets, yet also with something
of the jealous guardianship of watchdogs, is their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
usual escort of young men&mdash;for though they know none
of the fashionable women, their beauty gives them a
power of wide selection as to masculine society.</p>

<p>One is a show girl, famous in the way such girls become
famous in a New York season, vastly prosperous
(if one may judge by appearances), yet with a prosperity
founded upon the capitalization of youth and
amazing loveliness of person. The other two, less advertised,
but hardly less striking in appearance, have
been nicknamed, for the convenience of the gossips,
"The Queen of Sheba," and "The Queen of the May."
They too suggest, somehow, association with the trivial
stage, but it is said that one of them&mdash;the slender wonderfully
rounded one&mdash;has never had the footlights in
her face, but has been (in some respects, at least), a
model.</p>

<p>Like the climbers, like the bush league belle, these
girls, we judge, brought definite ambitions with them to
Palm Beach. Partly, no doubt, they came for pleasure,
but also one hears stories of successful ventures made
by men, on their behalf, at Beach Club tables, and of
costly rings and brooches which they now possess, although
they did not bring them with them. But after
all, the sources from which come their jeweled trinkets
may only be surmised, whereas, to the success of their
desire for fun, the eyes and ears of the entire smiling
beach bear witness. Watch them as they clasp hands
and run down to the water's edge; see them prancing
playfully where the waves die on the sand, while devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
swains launch the floating mattress upon which it is their
custom to bask so picturesquely; see them now as they
rush into the green waves and mount the softly rocking
thing; observe the gleam of their white arms as, idly,
they splash and paddle; note the languid grace of their
recumbence: chins on hands, heels waving lazily in
air; hear them squeal in inharmonious unison, as a young
member of the "Browning Club," makes as though to
splatter them, or mischievously threatens to overturn
their unwieldy couchlike craft. Free from the restriction
of ideas about "society," about the "tradition" of
Palm Beach, about "convention," they seem to detect
no difference between this resort and certain summer
beaches, more familiar to them, and at the same time
more used to boisterousness and cachinnation. They go
everywhere, these girls. You will see them having big
cocktails, in a little while, on the porch of the Breakers;
you will see them having tea, and dancing under the dry
rustling palm fronds of the cocoanut grove, when the
colored electric lights begin to glow in the luminous semi-tropical
twilight; and you will see them, resplendent,
at the Beach Club, dining, or playing at the green-topped
tables.</p>

<p>The Beach Club has been for some time, I suppose, the
last redoubt held in this country by the forces of open,
or semi-open gambling. Every now and then one hears
a rumor that it is to be stormed and taken by the hosts of
legislative piety, yet on it goes, upon its gilded way&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
place, it should be said, of orderly, spectacular distinction.
The Beach Club occupies a plain white house,
low-spreading and unpretentious, but fitted most agreeably
within, and boasting a superb cuisine. Not every
one is admitted. Members have cards, and must be
vouched for, formally, by persons known to those who
operate the place. Many of the quiet pleasant people
who, leading their own lives regardless of the splurging
going on about them, form the background of Palm
Beach life&mdash;much as "walking ladies and gentlemen"
form the crowd in a spectacular theatrical production&mdash;have
never seen the inside of the Beach Club; and I have
little doubt that many visitors who drop in at Palm
Beach for a few days never so much as hear of it. It is
not run for them, nor for the "piker," nor for the needy
clerk, but for the furious spenders.</p>

<p>Let us therefore view the Beach Club only as an interesting
adjunct to Palm Beach life, and let us admit
that, as such, it is altogether in the picture. Let us,
in short, seek, upon this brief excursion, not only to
recover from our case of grippe, but to recover also
that sense of the purely esthetic, without regard to moral
issues, which we used to enjoy some years ago, before
our legislatures legislated virtue into us. Let us soar,
upon the wings of our checkbook, in one final flight
to the realms of unalloyed beauty. Let us, in considering
this most extravagantly passionate and passionately
extravagant of American resorts, be great artists, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
are above morals. Let us refuse pointblank to consider
morals at all. For by so doing we may avoid giving
ourselves away.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The season wanes. Crowds on the beach grow thinner.
Millionaires begin to move their private cars from
Palm Beach sidings, and depart for other fashionable
places farther north. Croupiers at the Beach Club
stand idle for an hour at a time, though ready to spin the
wheel, invitingly, for any one who saunters in. The
shops hold cut-price sales. And we, regarding somewhat
sadly our white trousers, perceive that there does
not remain a single spotless pair. The girl in Mr. Foster's
fruit store has more leisure, now, and smiles agreeably
as we pass upon our way to the hotel dining-room.
The waiter, likewise, is not pressed for time.</p>

<p>"They was seven-hunduhd an' twe've folks heah yestahday,"
he says. "On'y six-fohty-three to-day. Ah
reckon they a-goin' t' close the Breakuhs day aftuh t'-mo'w."</p>

<p>Still the flowers bloom; still the place is beautiful; still
the weather is not uncomfortably warm. Nevertheless
the season dies. And so it comes about that we depart.</p>

<p>The ride through Florida is tedious. The miles of
palmettoes, with leaves glittering like racks of bared cutlasses
in the sun, the miles of dark swamp, in which the
cypresses seem to wade like dismal club-footed men, the
miles of live-oak strung with their sad tattered curtains
of Spanish moss, the miles of sandy waste, of pineapple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
and orange groves, of pines with feathery palm-like tops,
above all the sifting of fine Florida dust, which covers
everything inside the car as with a coat of flour&mdash;these
make you wish that you were North again.</p>

<p>The train stops at a station. You get off to walk
upon the platform. The row of hackmen and hotel porters
stand there, in gloomy silent defiance of the rapidly
approaching end of things, each holding a sign bearing
the name of some hotel. In another week the railway
company may, if it wishes, lift the ban on shouting hotel
runners. Let them shout. There will be nobody to
hear.</p>

<p>You buy a newspaper.</p>

<p>Ah! What is this? "Great Blizzard in New York&mdash;Trains
Late&mdash;Wires Down."</p>

<p>You know what New York blizzards are. You picture
the scenes being enacted there to-day. You see the
icy streets with horses falling down. You see cyclonic
clouds of snow whirl savagely around the corners of
high buildings, pelting the homegoing hoards, whirling
them about, throwing women down upon street crossings.
You have a vision of the muddy, slushy subway
steps, and slimy platforms, packed with people, their
clothing caked with wet white spangles. You see them
wedged, cross and damp, into the trains, and hear them
coughing into one another's necks. You see emaciated
tramps, pausing to gaze wanly into bakery windows:
men without overcoats, their collars turned up, their
hands deep in the pockets of their trousers, their heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
bent against the storm; you see them walk on to
keep from freezing. You remember Roscoe Conkling.
That sort of thing can happen in a New York blizzard!
Little tattered newsboys, thinly clad, will die to-night
upon cold corners. Poor widows, lacking money to buy
coal, are shuddering even now in squalid tenements, and
covering their wailing little ones with shoddy blankets.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" you say, sighing upon the balmy air.
Then, with the sweetly resigned philosophy of Palm
Beach, you add:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, what does it matter? <i>I'm</i> in Florida anyhow.
After all it is a pretty good old world!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

</div></div>


<p>Florida in winter comes near to being all things
to all men. To all she offers amusement plus
her climate, and in no one section is the contrast
in what amusement constitutes, and costs, set forth
more sharply than where, on the west coast of the State,
Belleair and St. Petersburg are situated, side by side.</p>

<p>The Hotel Belleview at Belleair compares favorably
with any in the State, and is peopled, during the cold
months, with affluent golf maniacs, for whom two fine
courses have been laid out.</p>

<p>When the pipes supplying water for the greens of
his home course, at Brook, Indiana, freeze, annually,
George Ade, for instance, knows that, instead of hibernating,
it is time for him to take his white flannel suits,
hang them on the clothesline in the back yard until the
fragrance of the moth-ball has departed, pack them in
his wardrobe trunk, and take his winter flight to the
Belleview. He knows that, at the Belleview, he will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
meet hundreds of men and women who are suffering
from the malady with which he is afflicted.</p>

<p>The conversation at Belleair is, so far as my companion
and I could learn, confined entirely to comparisons
between different courses, different kinds of clubs
and balls, and different scores. Belleair turns up its
nose at Palm Beach. It considers the game of golf as
played at Palm Beach a trifling game, and it feels that
the winter population of Palm Beach wastes a lot of
time talking about clothes and the stock market when it
might be discussing cleeks, midirons, and mashies.
The woman who thinks it essential to be blond whether
she is blond or not, and who regards Forty-second
Street as the axle upon which the universe turns, would
be likely to die of ennui in a week at Belleair, whereas,
in Palm Beach, if she died in that time, it would probably
be of delight&mdash;with a possibility of alcoholism as a
contributing cause. And likewise, though Belleair has
plutocrats in abundance, they are not starred for their
wealth, as are the Palm Beach millionaires, nor yet for
their social position, but are rated strictly according to
their club handicap. Hence it happens that if, speaking
of a Palm Beach millionaire, you ask: "How did
he make it?" you will be told the story of some combine
of trusts, some political grafting, or some widely advertised
patent medicine; but if you ask in Belleair: "How
did he make it?" the answer is likely to be: "He made
it in 4, with a cleek."</p>

<p>Consider on the other hand, St. Petersburg, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
cheap hotels, its boarding houses, its lunch rooms and
cafeterias, and its winter population of farmers and
their wives from the North. The people you see in St.
Petersburg are identical with those you might see on
market day in a county town of Ohio or Indiana. Several
thousands of them come annually from several
dozen States, and many a family of them lives through
the winter comfortably on less than some other families
spend at Belleair in a week, or at Palm Beach in a day.</p>

<p>If I am any judge of the signs of happiness, there
is plenty of it in the hearts of those who winter
at St. Petersburg. The city park is full of contented
people, most of them middle-aged or old. The women
listen to the band, and the men play checkers under the
palmetto-thatched shelter, or toss horseshoes on the
greensward, at the sign of the Sunshine Pleasure Club&mdash;an
occupation which is St. Petersburg's equivalent
for Palm Beach's game of tossing chips on the green-topped
tables of a gambling house. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Is it always pleasant to be virtuous? Is it always delightful
to be where pious people, na&iuml;ve people, people
who love simple pastimes, are enjoying themselves? I
am reminded of a talk I had with a negro whose strong
legs turned the pedals of a wheel chair in which my companion
and I rode one day through the Palm Beach
jungle trail. It is a wonderful place, that jungle, with
its tangled trunks and vines and its green foliage swimming
in sifted sunlight; with its palms, palmettoes, ferns,
and climbing morning-glories, its banana trees, gnarled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
rubber banyans, and wild mangoes&mdash;which are like
trees growing upside down, digging their spreading
branches into the ground. For a time we forgot the
pedaling negro behind us, but a faint puffing sound on a
slight up-grade reminded us, presently, that our party
was not of two, but three. When the chair was running
free again, one of us inquired of the chairman:</p>

<p>"What would you do if you had a million dollars?"</p>

<p>"Well, boss," replied the negro seriously, "Ah knows
one thing Ah'd do. No mattuh how much o' dis worl's
goods Ah haid, Ah'd allus get mah exuhcize."</p>

<p>"That's wise," my companion replied. "What kind
of exercise would you take?"</p>

<p>"Ah ain't nevvuh jest stedied dat out, boss," returned
the man. "But it sho' would be some kind o'
exuhcize besides pushin' one o' dese-heah chaihs."</p>

<p>"When you weren't exercising would you go and
have a good time?"</p>

<p>"No, boss."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, boss, y' see Ah's a 'ligious man, Ah is."</p>

<p>"But can't people who are religious have a good
time?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the negro, "dey might have deh little
pleasuhs now an' den, but dey cain't hev no sich good
times like othah folks kin. A man 't 's a 'ligious man,
he cain't hev no sich good times like Mistuh Wahtuhbe'y's

<p>"Ah took 'em ridin' through de jungle trail, boss," he
returned, innocently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span></p>

<p>The chair boys, bell boys, waiters, barbers, porters,
bartenders, waitresses, chambermaids, manicures, and
shop attendants one finds in Palm Beach, Belleair, Miami,
and many other winter resorts, are, numerically,
a not inconsiderable part of the season's population, and
the lives of these people who form a background of service,
of which many an affluent visitor is hardly conscious,
parallel the lives of the rich in a manner that is
not without a note of caricature.</p>

<p>When the rich go South so do the hordes that serve
them; when the Florida season begins to close and the
rich move northward, the serving population likewise
begins to melt away; if you are in Palm Beach near the
season's end, and move up to St. Augustine, or Jacksonville,
or Augusta, or any one of a dozen other places,
you are likely to recognize, here and there, a waiter, a
bell-boy, or a chambermaid whom you tipped, some
weeks earlier, preparatory to leaving a latitude several
degrees nearer the Equator. When you leave the Poinciana
or the Breakers at the season's close, your waiter
may, for all you know, be in the Jim Crow car, ahead,
and when you go in to dinner at the Ponce de Leon at
St. Augustine, or the Mason at Jacksonville, you may
discover that he too has stopped off there for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
days, to gather in the final tips. Nor must you fancy,
when you depart for the North, that you have seen the
last of him. Next summer when you take a boat up the
Hudson, or go to Boston by the Fall River Line, or drop
in at a hotel at Saratoga, there he will be, like an old
friend. The bartender who mixes you a pick-me-up on
the morning that you leave the Breakers, will be ready
to start you on the downward path, at the beginning of
the summer, at some Northern country club; the barber
who cuts your hair at the Royal Palm in Miami will be
ready to perform a like service, later on, at some
hotel in the Adirondacks or the White Mountains;
the neat waitress who serves you at the Belleview at
Belleair will appear before you three or four months
hence at the Griswold near New London; the adept
waiter from the Beach Club at Palm Beach will
seem to you to look like some one you have seen before
when, presently, he places viands before you at
Sherry's, or the Ritz, or some fashionable restaurant in
London or Paris. Likewise, when you enter the barber
shop of a large hostelry just off the board walk in Atlantic
City, next July, you will find there, in the same
generously ventilated shirt waist, the manicurist who
caused your nails to glisten so superbly in the Florida
sunlight; and if she has the memory for faces which is
no small part of a successful manicurist's stock in trade,
she will remember you, and where she saw you last, and
will tell you just which of the young women from "The
Follies" and the Century Theater are to be seen upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
the beach that day, and whether they are wearing, here
on the Jersey coast, those same surprising bathing suits
which, last February, caused blas&eacute; gentlemen basking
upon the Florida sands to sit up, arise, say it was time
for one last dip before luncheon, and then, without seeming
too deliberate about it, follow the amazing nymphs
in the direction of a matchless sea&mdash;that sea which, as a
background for these Broadway girls in their long silken
hosiery, takes on a tone of spectacular unreality, like
some fantastic marine back drop devised by Mr. Dillingham
or Mr. Ziegfeld.</p>

</div></div>


<p>As I have remarked before, it is a long haul from
the peninsula of Florida to New Orleans.
There are two ways to go. The route by way
of Pensacola, following the Gulf Coast, looks shorter on
the map but is, I believe, in point of time consumed, the
longer way. My companion and I were advised to go
by way of Montgomery, Alabama&mdash;a long way around
it looked&mdash;where we were to change trains, catching a
New Orleans-bound express from the North.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when, after a long tiresome
journey, we arrived in Alabama's capital, and after
midnight when we reached the comfortable if curiously
called Hotel Gay-Teague, which is not named for an
Indian chief or a kissing game, but for two men who
had to do with building it.</p>

<p>We had heard that Montgomery was a quiet, sleepy
old town, and had expected to go immediately to bed on
our arrival. What then was our amazement at hearing,
echoing through the wide street in front of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
hotel, the sound of strident ragtime. Investigation disclosed
a gaudily striped tent of considerable size set up
in the street and illuminated by those flaring naphtha
lamps they use in circuses. Going over to the tent, we
learned that there was dancing within, whereupon we
paid our fifteen cents apiece and entered. I have forgotten
what produced the music&mdash;it may have been a
mechanical piano or a hurdy-gurdy&mdash;but there was
music, and it was loud, and there was a platform laid
over the cobble-stones of the street, and on that platform
ten or more couples were "ragging," their shoulders
working like the walking beams of side-wheelers.
The men were of that nondescript type one would expect
to see in a fifteen-cent dancing place, but the women
were of curious appearance, for all were dressed alike,
the costume being a fringed khaki suit with knee-length
skirt, a bandana at the neck, and a sombrero. On inquiry
I learned that this was called a "cowgirl" costume.
The dances were very brief, and in the intervals
between them most of the dancers went to
a "bar" at the end of the tent where (Alabama
being a dry State) the beverage called "coca-cola"&mdash;a
habit as much as a drink&mdash;was being served in whisky
glasses.</p>

<span class="caption">The couples on the platform were &quot;ragging,&quot; their shoulders working like the walking-beams of side-wheelers</span>
</div>

<p>Unable to understand why this pageant of supposed
western mining-camp life should confront us in the
streets of Alabama's capital, I made inquiry of an amiable
policeman who was on duty in the tent, and learned
that this was not a regular Montgomery institution, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
one of the attractions of a street fair which had invaded
the city&mdash;the main body of the fair being a block or two
distant.</p>

<p>These fairs, he said, travel about the country much
as circuses do, making arrangements in advance with
various organizations in different places to stand sponsor
for them.</p>

<p>Long after we were in our beds that night we were
kept awake by the sound of ragtime from the tent across
the way. I arose next morning with the feeling of one
who has had insufficient sleep, and a glance at my companion,
who was already at table when I reached the
hotel dining room, informed me that he was suffering
from a like complaint. I took my seat opposite him in
silence, and he acknowledged my presence with a nod
which he accomplished without looking up from his
newspaper.</p>

<p>After breakfast there arrived a pleasant gentleman
who announced himself as secretary of one of the city's
commercial organizations.</p>

<p>"We have a motor here," said the secretary, "and will
show you points of interest. Is there anything in particular
you wish to see?"</p>

<p>"I think," said my companion, "that it would be a
good thing to see the street fair."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the secretary earnestly. "You don't
want to see that. There is nothing about it that is representative
of Montgomery. It is just a traveling show
such as you might run into anywhere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "but we never <i>have</i> run into one before,
and here it is."</p>

<p>"I have said right along," declared the secretary,
somberly, "that it was a great mistake to bring this fair
here at all. I don't think you ought to pay any attention
to it in your book. It will give people a wrong impression
of our city."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will, if I explain that it is just a
traveling fair?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait until you see what we have to show you.
We want you to understand that Montgomery is a thriving
metropolis, sir!"</p>

<p>"What is there to see?"</p>

<p>"Montgomery," he replied, "is known as 'The City of
Sunshine.' It is rich in history. It has superior hotels,
picturesque highways, good fishing and hunting, two
golf courses, seven theaters, a number of tennis courts,
and unsurpassed artesian water. It has free factory
sites, the cheapest electric power rates in the United
States, and is the best-lighted city in the country."</p>

<p>"We have some pretty fair street lighting in New
York," interjected my companion, who takes much pride
in his home town.</p>

<p>"I said '<i>one</i> of the best lighted,'" replied the secretary.</p>

<p>"What is the population?"</p>

<p>"Montgomery," the other returned, "is typical of
both the Old and the New South. Though it may be
called a modern model city, its wealth of history and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
tradition are preserved with loving care by its myriad
inhabitants."</p>

<p>"How many inhabitants?"</p>

<p>"Roses and other flowers are in bloom here throughout
the year," said he. "Also there are six hundred
miles of macadamized and picturesque highways in
Montgomery County. Indeed, this region is a motorist's
paradise."</p>

<p>"How many people did you say?"</p>

<p>"Montgomery," he answered, "is the trading center
for a million prosperous souls."</p>

<p>At this my companion, who had been reading up
Montgomery in a guidebook, began to bristle with hidden
knowledge.</p>

<p>"You say there are a million people here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Not right <i>here</i>," admitted the secretary.</p>

<p>"Well, how many do you claim?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-five thousand four hundred and ten."</p>

<p>"Right <i>in</i> the city?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the trolley-car territory."</p>

<p>"But in the city itself?" my companion insisted.</p>

<p>The secretary was fairly cornered. "The 1910 census,"
he said, with a smile, "gave us about forty thousand."</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight thousand one hundred and thirty-six,"
corrected my companion. He had not spent hours with
the guidebook for nothing.</p>

<p>When, presently, we got into the automobile, I gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
another feeble chirp about the fair, but the secretary
was adamant, so we yielded temporarily, and were
whirled about the city.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Montgomery is a charming old town, not only by
reason of the definite things it has to show, but also because
of a general rich suggestion of old southern
life.</p>

<p>The day, by a fortunate chance, was Saturday, and
everywhere we went we encountered negroes driving in
from the country to market, in their rickety old wagons.
On some wagons there would be four or five men and
women, and here and there one would be playing a
musical instrument and they would all be singing, while
the creaking of the wagon came in with an orchestral
quality which seemed grotesquely suitable. The
mules, too, looked as though they ought to creak, and an
inspection of the harness suggested that it was held together,
not so much by the string and wire with which
it was mended, as by the fingers of that especial Providence
which watches over all kinds of absurd repairs
made by negroes, and makes them hold for negroes,
where they would not hold for white men.</p>

<span class="caption">Harness held together by that especial Providence which watches over negro

</div>

<p>In an old buff-painted brick building standing on the
corner of Commerce and Bibb Streets, the Confederate
Government had its first offices, and from this building,
if I mistake not, was sent the telegraphic order to fire
on Fort Sumter. Another historical building is the
dilapidated frame residence at the corner of Bibb and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
Lee Streets, which was the first "White House of the
Confederacy." This building is now a boarding house,
and is in a pathetic state of decay. But perhaps when
Montgomery gets up the energy to build a fine tourist
hotel, or when outside capital comes in and builds one,
the old house will be furbished up to provide a "sight"
for visitors.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why Montgomery would
be a good place for a large winter-resort hotel, and if I
were a Montgomery "booster" I should give less thought
to free factory sites than to building up the town as a
winter stopping place for tourists. The town itself is
picturesque and attractive; as to railroads it is well situated
(albeit the claim that Montgomery is the "Gateway
to Florida" strikes me as a little bit exaggerated); the
climate is delightful, and the surrounding country is not
only beautiful but fertile. Furthermore, there are already
two golf clubs&mdash;one for Jews and one for Gentiles&mdash;and
the links are reputed to be good.</p>

<p>Unlike many southern cities of moderate size, Montgomery
has well-paved streets, and the better residence
streets, being wide, and lined with trees and pleasant
houses, each in its own lawn, give a suggestion of an
agreeable home and social life&mdash;a suggestion which, by
implication at least, report substantiates: for it has been
said that the chief industry of Montgomery is that of
raising beautiful young women to make wives for the
rich men of Birmingham.</p>

<p>On such pleasant thoroughfares as South Perry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
Street, it may be noticed that many of the newer houses
have taken their architectural inspiration from old ones,
with the result that, though "originality" does not jump
out at the passer-by, as it does on so many streets, North
and South, which are lined with the heterogeneous
homes of prosperous families, there is an agreeable
architectural harmony over the town.</p>

<p>This is not, of course, invariably true, but it is truer,
I think, in Montgomery than in most other cities, and
if Montgomery is defaced by the funny little settlement
called Bungalow City, that settlement is, at least, upon
the outskirts of the town. Bungalow City is without
exception the queerest real-estate development I ever
saw. It consists of several blocks of tiny houses, standing
on tiny lots, the scale of everything being so small
as to suggest a play village for children. The houses
are, however, homes, and I was told that in some of
them all sorts of curious space-saving devices are installed&mdash;as,
for instance, tables and beds which can be
folded into the walls. Not far from this little settlement
is an old house which used to be the home of Tweed,
New York's notorious political boss, who, it is said,
used to spend much time here.</p>

<p>The chief lion of the city is the old State House, which
stands on a graceful eminence in a small well-kept park.
Just as the New York State Capitol is probably the most
shamefully expensive structure of the kind in the entire
country, that of Alabama is, I fancy, the most creditably
inexpensive. Building and grounds cost $335,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
Moreover, the Capitol of Alabama is a better-looking
building than that of New York, for it is without gingerbread
trimmings, and has about it the air of honest simplicity
that an American State House ought to have. Of
course it has a dome, and of course it has a columned
portico, but both are plain, and there is a large clock, in
a quaint box-like tower, over the peak of the portico,
which contributes to the building a curious touch of individuality.
At the center of the portico floor, under
this clock, a brass plate marks the spot where Jefferson
Davis stood when he delivered his inaugural address,
February 18, 1861, and in the State Senate Chamber,
within&mdash;a fine simple room with a gallery of peculiar
grace&mdash;the Provisional Government of the Confederacy
was organized. The flag of the Confederacy was, I believe,
adopted in this room, and was first flung to the
breeze from the Capitol building.</p>

<p>It was past three in the afternoon when we left the
State House, and we had had no luncheon.</p>

<p>"Now," said my companion as we returned to the
automobile, "I think we had better have something to
eat, and then go to the fair."</p>

<p>"But you were going to give up the fair," put in the
secretary.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," we said in chorus.</p>

<p>"I have arranged about luncheon," he returned.
"We will have it served at the hotel in a short time.
But first there are some important sights I wish you to
see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span></p>

<p>"Man shall not live by sights alone," objected my companion.
"What are you going to show us?"</p>

<p>"We have a beautiful woman's college."</p>

<p>"That," said my companion, "is the one thing that
could tempt me. How many beautiful women are
there?"</p>

<p>"It's not the women&mdash;it's the building," the secretary
explained.</p>

<p>"Then," said my companion firmly, "I think we'd better
go and have our lunch."</p>

<p>It seemed to me time to back him up in this demand.
By dint of considerable insistence we persuaded our enthusiastic
cicerone to drive to the hotel, where we found
a table already set for us.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," said the secretary as we sat
down, "about the agricultural progress this section has
been making. Until recently our farmers raised nothing
but cotton; they didn't even feed themselves, but
lived largely on canned goods. But the boll weevil and
the European War, affecting the cotton crop and the
cotton market as they did, forced the farmers to wake
up."</p>

<p>The secretary talked interestingly on this subject for
perhaps a quarter of an hour, during which time we
waited for luncheon to be served.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "our climate is such that it is possible
to rotate crops more than in most parts of the
country. Cotton is now a surplus crop with us, and our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
farmers are raising cattle, vegetables, and food products."</p>

<p>"Speaking of food products," said my companion, "I
wonder if we could hurry up the lunch?"</p>

<p>"It will be along in a little while," soothed the secretary.
Then he returned to agriculture.</p>

<p>Ten minutes more passed. I saw that my companion
was becoming nervous.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you," he said at last, "but if we
can't speed up this luncheon, I don't see how I can wait.
You see, we are leaving town this evening, and I have
an awful lot to do."</p>

<p>"I'll step back and investigate," the secretary said,
rising and moving toward the kitchen door.</p>

<p>When he was out of hearing, my companion leaned
toward me.</p>

<p>"I suspect this fellow!" he said.</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>"I think he's delaying us on purpose. He's a nice
chap, but it's his business to boost this town, and he's
artful. He doesn't want us to see the street fair.
That's why he's stalling like this!"</p>

<p>Now, however, the secretary returned, followed by a
waiter bearing soup.</p>

<p>The soup was fine, but it was succeeded by another
long interval, during which the secretary said some
very, very beautiful things about the charm of Montgomery
life. However, it was clear to me that my com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>panion
was not interested. After he had looked at his
watch several times, and drummed a long tattoo upon
the table, he arose, declaring:</p>

<p>"I can't wait another minute."</p>

<p>"Sit down, my dear fellow," said the secretary in his
most genial tone. "I am having some special southern
dishes prepared for you."</p>

<p>"You're very kind," said my companion, "but I must
get to work. It's half-past four now; we are leaving
in a few hours. It will take me an hour to make my
sketches, and the light will be failing pretty soon."</p>

<p>"What are you going to sketch?" It seemed to me
that there was suppressed emotion in the secretary's
voice as he asked the question.</p>

<p>"Why, the street fair."</p>

<p>"Surely, you're not going to <i>draw</i> it?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's not representative of Montgomery. You ought
to do something representative! What pictures have
you made here?"</p>

<p>"I made one of those negroes driving in to market,"
said my companion, "and one of the dancing cowgirls
in the tent across the way&mdash;the ones who kept us awake
last night."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried the secretary, turning to me. "You
intend to print such pictures and say that they represent
the normal life of this city?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't say anything about it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" the secretary arose and looked wanly at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
illustrator&mdash;"but you haven't drawn any of our pretty
homes! You didn't draw the golf clubs&mdash;not either one
of them! You didn't draw the State House, or the
Confederate Monument, or the Insane Asylum, or
anything!"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time."</p>

<p>"Well, you have time now! I tell you what: We'll
let this luncheon go. I'll take you to the top of our
tallest building, and you can draw a panoramic bird's-eye
view of the entire city. That will be worth while."</p>

<p>My companion reached out, helped himself to a French
roll, and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I will not go to the top of a high
building with you."</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," he replied, "I am afraid you would try to
push me off the roof to prevent my drawing the street
fair."</p>

<p>I do not remember that the secretary denied having
harbored such a plan. At all events, he countermanded
the remainder of the luncheon order and departed with
us.</p>

<p>At the entrance of an office building he made one final
desperate appeal: "Just come up to the top floor and
see the view!"</p>

<p>But we stood firm, and he continued with us on our
way.</p>

<p>The fair was strung along both sides of a wide,
cobbled street. It was really a very jolly fair, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
usual lot of barkers and the usual gaping crowd, plus
many negroes, who stood fascinated before the highly
colored canvas signs outside the tents, with their bizarre
pictures of wild animals, snake charmers, "Nemo, the
Malay Prince," and "The Cigarette Fiend," pictured
as a ghastly emaciated object with a blue complexion,
and billed as "Endorsed by the Anti-Cigarette League
of America." I wished to inquire why an anti-cigarette
league should indorse a cigarette fiend, but lack of time
compelled us to press on, leaving the apparent paradox
unsolved.</p>

<span class="caption">It was a very jolly fair, with the usual lot of barkers and the usual gaping crowd</span>
</div>

<p>As we progressed between the tents and the booths
with their catchpenny "wheels of fortune," and ring-tossing
enticements, the secretary maintained a protesting
silence.</p>

<p>Near the end of the block we stopped to listen to a
particularly vociferous barker. I saw my companion
take his pad from his pocket and place it under his
arm, while he sharpened a pencil.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried the secretary. "Come across the
square and let me show you our beautiful bronze fountain.
Draw that!"</p>

<p>But my companion was already beginning to sketch.
He was drawing the barker and the crowd.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an expression of horror came into the
secretary's face. Looking at him, I became conscience-stricken.</p>

<p>"Come away," I said gently, taking him by the arm.
"Don't watch him draw. He draws wonderfully, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
Art for Art's sake doesn't appeal to you just now. The
better he draws the worse it will make you feel. Let me
get your mind off all this. Let me take you over to the
autodrome, where we can see Mr. O.&nbsp;K. Hager and his
beautiful sister, Miss Olive Hager, the 'Two Daredevil
Motorcyclists, in the Thrilling Race against Death.'
That will make you forget."</p>

<p>"No," said the secretary, shaking his head with a despondency
the very sight of which made me sad; "I have
letters to sign at the office."</p>

<p>"And we have taken up your whole day!"</p>

<p>"It has been a pleasure," he said kindly. "There is
only one thing that worries me. Those drawings are
not going to represent what is typical of Montgomery
life. Not in the least!"</p>

<p>There arose in me a sudden desire to comfort him.</p>

<p>"How would it be," I suggested, "if I were to print
that statement in my book?"</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"But you couldn't very well do that, could you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied.</p>

<p>His face brightened. It was delightful to see the
change come over him.</p>

<p>"For that matter," I went on, "I might say even more.
I could say that, while I admire my companion as a man,
and as an artist, he lacks ingenuity in ordering breakfast.
He always reads over the menu and then orders
a baked apple and scrambled eggs and bacon. Would
you like me to attack him on that line also?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the secretary. "Nothing of that kind.
It's just about these pictures. They aren't representative.
If you'll say that, I'll be more than satisfied."</p>

<p>Presently we parted.</p>

<p>"Don't forget!" he said as we shook hands in farewell.</p>

<p>And I have not forgotten. Moreover, to give full
measure, I am going to ask the printer to set the statement
in italics:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The drawings accompanying this chapter are not representative
of what is typical of Montgomery life.</i></p></div>

<p>With this statement my companion is in full accord.
He admits that he would have drawn the State House
had there been no fair, to interfere. But, as with certain
items on the breakfast bill, street fairs are a passion
with him. And so they are with me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>

<br />
THE CITY OF THE CREOLE</h2>


<p>When a poet, a painter, or a sculptor wishes
to personify a city, why does he invariably
give it the feminine gender? Why is this
so, even though the city be named for a man, or for a
masculine saint? And why is it so in the case of commonplace
cities, commercial cities, and ugly, sordid
cities? It is not difficult to understand why a beautiful,
sparkling city, like Washington or Paris, suggests
a handsome woman, richly gowned and bedecked with
jewels, but it is hard to understand why some other
cities, far less pleasing, seem somehow to be stamped
with the qualities of woman-nature rather than man-nature.
Is it perhaps because the nature of all cities is
so complicated? Is it because they are volatile, changeful,
baffling? Or is it only that they are the mothers
of great families of men?</p>

<p>When I arrive in a strange city I feel as though I
were making the acquaintance of a woman of whom I
have often heard. I am curious about her. I am alert.
I gaze at her eagerly, wondering if she is as I have imagined
her. I try to read her expression while listening
to her voice. I consider her raiment, noticing whether
it is fine, whether it is good only in spots, and whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
it is well put together. I inspect the important buildings,
boulevards, parks, and monuments with which she
is jeweled, and judge by them not only of her prosperity,
but of her sense of beauty. Before long I have
a distinct impression of her. Sometimes, as with a
woman, this first impression has to be revised; sometimes
not. Sometimes, on acquaintance, a single feature,
or trait, becomes so important in my eyes that all
else seems inconsequential. A noble spirit may cover
physical defects; beauty may seem to compensate for
weaknesses of character. The spell of a beautiful city
which is bad resembles the spell of such a city's prototype
among women.</p>

<p>Some young growing cities are like young growing
women of whom we think: "She is as yet unformed,
but she will fill out and become more charming as she
grows older." Or again we think: "She is somewhat
dowdy and run down at the heels but she is ambitious,
and is replenishing her wardrobe as she can afford it."
One expects such failings in young cities, and readily
forgives them where there is wholesome promise for
the future. But where old cities become slovenly, the
affair is different, for then it means physical decay, and
physical decay should never come to a city&mdash;for a
city is not only feminine, but should be immortal. The
symbol for every city should be a goddess, forever in
her prime.</p>

<p>Among southern cities Richmond is the <i>grande dame</i>;
she is gray and distinguished, and wears handsome old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
brocades and brooches. Richmond is aquiline and crisp
and has much "manner." But though Charleston is
actually the older, the wonderful beauty of the place, the
softness of the ancient architectural lines, the sweet
scents wafting from walled gardens, the warmth of
color everywhere, gives the place that very quality of
immortal youth and loveliness which is so rare in cities,
and is so much to be desired. Charleston I might allegorize
in the person of a young woman I met there. I
was in the drawing-room of a fine old house; a beautifully
proportioned room, paneled to the ceiling, hung
with family portraits and other old paintings, and furnished
with mahogany masterpieces a century and a
half old. The girl lived in this house. She was not
exactly pretty, nor was her figure beautiful in the usual
sense; yet it was beautiful, all the same, with a sort of
long-limbed, supple, aristocratic aliveness. Most of all
there was about her a great fineness&mdash;the kind of fineness
which seems to be the expression of generations of
fineness. She was the granddaughter of a general in
the Civil War, the great-granddaughter of an ambassador,
the great-great-granddaughter of a Revolutionary
hero, and though one could not but be thankful that
she failed of striking resemblance to the portraits of
these admirable ancestors, nevertheless it seemed to me
that, had I not known definitely of their place in her
family history, I might almost have sensed them hovering
behind her: a background, nebulous and shadowy,
out of which she had emerged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span></p>

<p>Memphis, upon the other hand, will always be to me a
lively modern d&eacute;butante. I vision her as dancing&mdash;dancing
to Handy's ragtime music&mdash;all shoulders, neck,
and arms, and tulle, and twenty-dollar satin slippers.
Atlanta, too, is young, vivid, affluent, altogether modern;
while as for Birmingham, she is pretty, but a little
strident, a little overdressed; touched a little with the
amiability, and the other qualities, of the <i>nouveau riche</i>.</p>

<p>The beauty of New Orleans is of a different kind.
She is a full-blown, black-eyed, dreamy, drawly creature,
opulent of figure, white of skin, and red of lip.
Like San Francisco she has Latin blood which makes
her love and preserve the carnival spirit; but she is more
voluptuous than San Francisco, for not only is she
touched with the languor and the fire of her climate,
but she is without the virile blood of the forty-niner, or
the invigorating contact of the fresh Pacific wind. In
my imaginary picture I see her yawning at eleven in the
morning, when her negro maid brings black coffee to
her bedside&mdash;such wonderful black coffee!&mdash;whereas,
at that hour, I conceive San Francisco as having long
been up and about her affairs. Even in the afternoon
I fancy my New Orleans beauty as a little bit relaxed.
But at dinner she becomes alive, and after dinner more
alive, and by midnight she is like a flame.</p>

<p>I must admit, however, that of late years New
Orleans has developed a perfect case of dual personality,
and that, as often happens where there is dual personality,
one side of her nature seems altogether incom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>patible
with the other. The very new New Orleans has
no resemblance to the picture I have drawn; moreover,
my picture is not her favorite likeness of herself. She
prefers more recent ones&mdash;pictures showing the lines
of determination which, within the last ten years have
stamped themselves upon her features, as she has fought
and overcome the defects of character which logically
accompanied her peculiar, temperamental type of
charm. I, upon the other hand, am like some lover who
values most an older picture of the woman he adores.
I admire her for building character, but it is by her
languorous beauty that I am infatuated, and the portrait
which most effectively displays that beauty is the
one for which I care.</p>

<p>Her very failings were so much a part of her that
they made us the more sympathetic; she was too lovely
to be greatly blamed for anything; gazing into her eyes,
we hardly noticed that there was dust under the piano
and in the corners; dining at her sumptuous table, we
gave but little thought to the fact that the cellar was
damp, the house none too healthy, and that there were
mosquitoes and rats about the place; nor did it seem to
matter, in face of her allurements, that she was shiftless,
extravagant, improvident in the management of
her affairs. If these things were brought to our attention,
we excused them on the grounds of Latin blood
and enervating climate.</p>

<p>But if we excused her, she did not excuse herself.
Without being shaken awake by an earthquake, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
forced to action by a devastating fire or flood, she set
to work, calmly and of her own volition, to reform her
character.</p>

<p>First she cleaned house, providing good surface drainage,
an excellent filtered water supply from the river
in place of her old mosquito-breeding cisterns, and modern
sewers in place of cesspools. She killed rats by the
hundreds of thousands, rat-proofed her buildings, and
thus, at one stroke, eliminated all fear of bubonic plague.
She began to take interest in the public schools, and
soon trebled their advantages. She concerned herself
with the revision of repressive tax laws. She secured
one of the best street railway systems in the country.
But, perhaps most striking of all, she set to work to
build scientifically toward the realization of a gigantic
dream. This dream embodies the resumption by New
Orleans of her old place as second seaport city. To
this end she is doing more than any other city to revive
the commerce of the Mississippi River, and is at the
same time making a strong bid for trade by way of the
Panama Canal, as well as other sea traffic. She has
restored her forty miles of water front to the people,
has built municipal docks and warehouses at a cost of
millions, and has so perfectly co&ouml;rdinated her river-rail-sea
traffic-handling agencies that rates have been
greatly reduced. Upon these, and related enterprises,
upward of a hundred millions are being spent, and the
vast plan is working out with such promise that one
almost begins to fear lest New Orleans become too much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
enamored of her new-found materialism&mdash;lest the easy-going,
pleasure-loving, fascinating Creole belle be transformed
into the much-less-rare and much-less-desirable
business type of woman: a woman whose letters, instead
of being written in a fine French hand and scented with
the faint fragrance of vertivert, are typewritten upon
commercial paper; whose lips, instead of causing one
to think of kisses, are laden with the deadly cant of
commerce; whose skin, instead of seeming to be made
of milk and rose leaves, is dappled with industrial soot.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield in one of his letters to his son, intimated
that beautiful women desire to be flattered upon
their intelligence, while intelligent women who are not
altogether ugly like to be told that they are beautiful.
So with New Orleans. Speak of her individuality, her
picturesqueness, her gift of laughter, and she will listen
with polite ennui; but admire her commercial progress
and she will hang upon your words. Gaiety and charm
are so much a part of her that she not only takes them
as a matter of course, but seems to doubt, sometimes,
that they are virtues. She is like some unusual and
fascinating woman who, instead of rejoicing because
she is not like all other women, begins to wonder if she
ought not to be like them. Perhaps she is wrong to be
gay? Perhaps her carnival proves her frivolous? Perhaps
she ought not to continue to hold a carnival each
year?</p>

<p>Far to the north of New Orleans the city of St. Paul
was afflicted, some years since, by a similar agitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
It will be remembered that St. Paul used to build an ice
palace each year. People used to go to see it as they
go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Then came some
believer in the standardization of cities, advancing the
idea that ice palaces advertised St. Paul as a cold place.
As a result they ceased to be built. St. Paul threw
away something which drew attention to her and which
gave her character. Moreover, I am told this mania
went so far that when folders were issued for the purpose
of advertising the region, they were designed to
suggest the warmth and brilliance of the tropics. Had
St. Paul a bad climate, instead of a peculiarly fine one,
we might feel sympathetic tolerance for these performances,
but a city which enjoys cool summers and dry,
bracing winters has no apologies to make upon the score
of climate, and only need apologize if she tries to make
us think that bananas and cocoanuts grow on sugar-maple
trees. However, in the last year or two, St. Paul
has perceived the folly of her course, and has resumed
her annual carnival.</p>

<p>In the case of New Orleans I cannot believe there is
real danger that the carnival will be given up. Instead,
I believe that the business enthusiasts will be appeased&mdash;as
they were a year or two ago, for the first time in
carnival history&mdash;by the inclusion of an industrial
pageant glorifying the city's commercial renaissance.
Also the New Orleans newspapers soothe the spirit of
the Association of Commerce, at carnival time, by publishing
items presumably furnished by that capable or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>ganization,
showing that business is going on as usual,
that bank clearings have not diminished during the festivities,
and that, despite the air of happiness that pervades
the town, New Orleans is not really beginning to
have such a good time as a stranger might suppose from
superficial signs. With such concessions made to solemn
visaged commerce, is the carnival continued.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There are at least six cities on this continent which
every one should see. Every one should see New York
because it is the largest city in the world, and because
it combines the magnificence, the wonder, the beauty,
the sordidness, and the shame of a great metropolis;
every one should see San Francisco because it is so
vivid, so alive, so golden; every one should see Washington,
the clean, white splendor of which is like the
embodiment of a national dream; every one should see
the old gray granite city of Quebec, piled on its hill above
the river like some fortified town in France; every one
should see the sweet and aristocratic city of Charleston,
which suggests a museum of tradition and early American
elegance; and of course every one should see New
Orleans.</p>

<p>As to whether it is best to see the city in everyday
attire, or masked for the revels, that is a matter of
taste, and perhaps of age as well. To any one who
loves cities, New Orleans is always good to see, while
to the lover of spectacles and f&ecirc;tes the carnival is also
worth seeing&mdash;once. The two are, however, hardly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
be seen to advantage simultaneously. To visit New
Orleans in carnival time is like visiting some fine old
historic mansion when it is all in a flurry over a fancy-dress
ball. The furniture is moved, master, mistress
and servants are excited, the cook is overworked and
is perhaps complaining a little, and the brilliant costumes
of the masquerade divert the eye of the visitor
so that he hardly knows what sort of house he is in.
Attend the ball if you like, but do not fail to revisit
the house when normal conditions have been restored;
see the festivities of Mardi Gras if you will, but do not
fail to browse about old New Orleans and sit down at
her famous tables when her chefs have time to do their
best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span></p>

<br />
HISTORY, THE CREOLE, AND HIS DUELS</h2>


<p>Canal Street is to New Orleans much more
than Main Street is to Buffalo, much more than
Broad Street is to Philadelphia, much more
than Broadway and Fifth Avenue are to New York, for
Canal Street divides New Orleans as no other street
divides an American city. It divides New Orleans as
the Seine divides Paris, and there is not more difference
between the right bank of the Seine and the Latin
Quarter than between American New Orleans and
Creole New Orleans: between the newer part of the city
and the <i>vieux carr&eacute;</i>. The sixty squares ("islets" according
to the Creole idiom, because each block was
literally an islet in time of flood) which comprise the old
French town established in 1718 by the Sieur de Bienville,
are unlike the rest of the city not merely in architecture,
but in all respects. The street names change
at Canal Street, the highways become narrower as you
enter the French quarter, and the pavements are made
of huge stone blocks brought over long ago as ballast in
sailing ships. Nor is the difference purely physical.
For though they will tell you that this part of the city
is not so French and Spanish as it used to be, that it has
run down, that large parts of it have been given over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
Italians of the lower class, and to negroes, it remains
not only in appearance, but in custom, thought and
character, the most perfectly foreign little tract of land
in the whole United States. Long ago, under the
French flag, it was a part of the Roman Catholic bishopric
of Quebec; later under the Spanish flag, a part of
that of Havana; and it is charming to trace in old
buildings, names, and customs the signs of this blended
French and Spanish ancestry.</p>

<p>La Salle, searching out a supposed route to China
by way of the Mississippi River, seems to have perceived
what the New Orleans Association of Commerce
perceives to-day: that the control of the mouth of the
river ought to mean also the control of a vast part of
the continent. At all events, he took possession in 1682
in the name of the French King, calling the river St.
Louis and the country Louisiana. The latter name
persisted, but La Salle himself later rechristened the
river, giving it the name Colbert, thereby showing that
in two attempts he could not find a name one tenth as
good as that already provided by the savages. The "St.
Louis River" might, from its name, be a fair-sized
stream, but "Colbert" sounds like the name of a river
about twenty miles long, forty feet wide at the mouth,
and five feet deep at the very middle.</p>

<p>La Salle intended to build a fort at a point sixty
leagues above the mouth of the river, but his expedition
met with disaster upon disaster, until at last he was assassinated
in Texas, when setting out on foot to seek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
help from Canada. In 1699 came Iberville, the Canadian,
exploring the river and fixing on the site for the
future city. Iberville established settlements at old
Biloxi (now Ocean Springs) and Mobile, but before he
had time to make a town at New Orleans he caught
yellow fever at Havana, and died there. It therefore
remained for his brother, Bienville, actually to establish
the town, and New Orleans is Bienville's city, just
as Detroit is Cadillac's, and Cleveland General Moses
Cleveland's.</p>

<p>Bienville's settlers were hardy pioneers from Canada,
and presently we find him writing to France:
"Send me wives for my Canadians. They are running
in the woods after Indian girls." The priests also
urged that unless white wives could be sent out for the
settlers, marriages with Indians be sanctioned.</p>

<p>Having now a considerable investment in Louisiana,
France felt that a request for wives for the colony was
practical and legitimate. Louisiana must have population.
A bonus of so much per head was offered for
colonists, and hideous things ensued: servants, children,
and helpless women were kidnapped, and the occupants
of hospitals, asylums, and houses of correction were
assembled and deported. Incidentally it will be remembered
that out of these black deeds flowered "the first
masterpiece of French literature which can properly be
called a novel," the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost's "Manon Lescaut,"
which has been dramatized and redramatized, and
which is the theme of operas by both Massenet and Puc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>cini.
Though a grave alleged to be that of Manon
used to be shown on the outskirts of the city, there is
doubt that such a person actually existed, although those
who wish to believe in a flesh-and-blood Manon may perhaps
take encouragement from the fact that the arrival
in the colony of a Chevalier des Grieux, in the year
1719, fourteen years before the book appeared, has been
established, and, further, that the name of the Chevalier
des Grieux may be seen upon a crumbling tomb in
one of the river parishes.</p>

<p>When the girls arrived they were on inspection in the
daytime, but at night were carefully guarded by soldiers,
in the house where they were quartered together.
Miss Grace King, in her delightful book, "New Orleans,
the Place and the People," tells us that in these times
there were never enough girls to fill the demand for
wives, and that in one instance two young bachelors proposed
to fight over a very plain girl&mdash;the last one left
out of a shipload&mdash;but that the commandant obliged
them to settle their dispute by the more pacific means of
drawing lots. As the place became settled Ursuline
sisters arrived and established schools. And at last, a
quarter of a century after the landing of the first shipment
of girls, the curious history of female importations
ended with the arrival of that famous band of sixty
demoiselles of respectable family and "authenticated
spotless reputation," who came to be taken as wives by
only the more prosperous young colonists of the better
class. The earlier, less reputable girls have come down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
to us by the name of "correction girls," but these later
arrivals&mdash;each furnished by the Company of the West
with a casket containing a trousseau&mdash;are known to this
day as <i>les filles &agrave; la cassette</i>, or "casket girls."</p>

<p>A curious feature of this bit of history, as it applies
to present-day New Orleans, is that though one hears
of many families that claim descent from some nice,
well-behaved "casket girl," one never by any chance
hears of a family claiming to be descended from a lady
of the other stock. When it is considered that the "correction
girls" far outnumbered their virtuous sisters of
the casket, and ought, therefore, by the law of averages,
to have left a greater progeny, the matter becomes
stranger still, taking on a scientific interest. The explanation
must, however, be left to some mind more astute
than mine&mdash;some mind capable, perhaps, of unraveling
also those other riddles of New Orleans namely:
Who was the mysterious chevalier who many years ago
invented that most delectable of <i>sucreries</i>, the praline,
and whither did he vanish? And how, although the refugee
Duc d'Orleans (later Louis Philippe of France)
stayed but a short time in New Orleans, did he manage
to sleep in so many hundred beds, and in houses which
were not built until long after his departure? And why
are so many of the signs, over bars, restaurants, and
shops, of that blue and white enamel one associates with
the signs of the Western Union Telegraph Company?
And why is the nickel as characteristic of New Orleans
as is the silver dollar of the farther Middle West, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
gold coin of the Pacific Slope&mdash;why, when one pays for
a ten-cent purchase with a half-dollar, does one receive
eight nickels in change? Ah, but New Orleans is a
mysterious city!</p>

<p>Once, when the French and English were fighting for
the possession of Canada and New Orleans was depending
for protection on Swiss mercenaries, the French officer
in command of these troops disciplined them by
stripping them and tying them to trees, where they were
a prey to the terrible mosquitoes of the Gulf. One day
they killed him and fled, but some of them were captured.
These were taken back to New Orleans, court-martialed,
and punished according to the regulations:
they were nailed alive to their coffins and sawed in two.</p>

<p>Ceded to Spain by a secret clause in the Treaty of
Paris, of which she did not know until 1764, Louisiana
could not believe the news. Even when the Acadians,
appeared, after having been so cruelly ejected from their
lands in what is now New Brunswick, Louisiana could
not believe that Louis XV would coldly cast off his loyal
colony. The fact that he had done so was not credited
until a Spanish governor arrived. For three years
after, there was confusion. Then a strong force was
sent from Spain under Count O'Reilly, a man of Irish
birth, but Spanish allegiance, and the flag of Spain was
raised. O'Reilly maintained viceregal splendor; he invited
leading citizens to a levee; here in his own house
he caused his soldiers to seize the group of prominent
men who had attempted to prevent the accomplishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
of Spanish rule, and five of these he presently caused to
be shot as rebels.</p>

<p>Spanish governors came and went. The people
settled down. At one time Padre Antonio de Sedella,
a Spanish Capuchin, arrived with a commission to establish
in the city the Holy office of the Inquisition, but
he was discouraged and shipped back to Cadiz. Miss
King tells us that when, half a century later, the calaboose
was demolished, secret dungeons containing instruments
of torture were discovered.</p>

<p>On Good Friday, 1788, fire broke out, and as the
priests refused to let the bells be rung in warning, saying
that all bells must be dumb on Good Friday, the conflagration
gained such headway that it could not be checked,
and a large part of the old French town was reduced to
ashes. Six years later another fire equally destructive,
completed the work of blotting out the French town, and
the old New Orleans we now know is the Spanish city
which arose in its place: a city not of wood but of adobe
or brick, stuccoed and tinted, of arcaded walks, galleries,
jalousies, ponderous doors, and inner courts with carriage
entrances from the street, and, behind, the most
charming and secluded gardens. Also, owing to premiums
offered by Baron Carondelet, the governor, tile
roofs came into vogue, so that the city became comparatively
fireproof. Much of the present-day charm of
the old city is due also to the noble Andalusian, Don
Andreas Almonaster y Roxas, who having immigrated
and made a great fortune in the city, became its bene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>factor,
building schools and other public institutions, the
picturesque old Cabildo, or town hall, which is now a
most fascinating museum, the cathedral, which adjoins
the Cabildo, and which, like it, faces Jackson Square,
formerly the Place d'Armes. In front of the altar of
his cathedral Don Andreas is buried, and masses are
said, in perpetuity, for his soul. When the Don's young
widow remarried, she and her husband were pursued
by a charivari lasting three days and three nights&mdash;the
most famous charivari in the history of a city widely
noted for these detestable functions. The Don's
daughter, a great heiress, became the Baronne Po&ntilde;talba
and resided in magnificence in Paris, where she
died, a very old woman, in 1874.</p>

<p>In the Place d'Armes much of the early history of
New Orleans, and indeed, of Louisiana, was written.
Here, and in the Cabildo, the transfers from flag to flag
took place, ending with the ceding of Louisiana by Spain
to France, and by France to the United States. At this
time New Orleans had about ten thousand inhabitants,
most of the whites being Creoles.</p>

<p>Harris Dickson, who knows a great deal about New
Orleans, declared in an article published some years ago,
that outside lower Louisiana the word "Creole" is still
misunderstood, and added this definition of the term:
"A person of mixed French and Spanish blood, born in
Louisiana." As I understand it, however, the blood
need not necessarily be mixed, but may be pure Spanish
or pure French, or again, there may be some admixture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
of English blood. The word itself was, I am informed,
originally Spanish, and signified an American descended
from Spaniards; later it got into the language of the
French West Indies, whence it was imported, to Louisiana,
about the end of the eighteenth century, by refugees
who arrived in considerable numbers from San Domingo,
after the revolution of the blacks there. Thus,
the early French settlers did not use the word.</p>

<p>If any misapprehension as to whether a Creole is a
white person does still exist, that misunderstanding is,
I believe, to be traced to the doors of an old-time cheap
burlesque theater in Chicago, where the late impresario,
Sam T. Jack, put on a show in which mulatto women
were billed as "a galaxy of Creole beauties." This
show traveled about the country libeling the Creoles and
doubtless causing many persons of that class which attended
Sam T. Jack's shows, to believe that "Creole"
means something like "quadroon." But when the show
got to Baton Rouge the manager was waited upon by a
committee of citizens who said certain things to him
which caused him to give up his engagement there and
cancel any other engagements he had in the Creole
country.</p>

<p>True, one frequently hears references in New Orleans
to "Creole mammies," and "Creole negroes," but the
word used in that sense merely indicates a negro who
has been the servant of Creoles, and who speaks French&mdash;"gombo
French" the curious dialect is called. Similarly
one hears of "Creole ponies"&mdash;these being ponies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
of the small, strong type used by the Cajan farmers.
According to the Louisiana dialect Longfellow's "Evangeline"
was a Cajan, the word being a corruption of
"Acadian." About a thousand of these unfortunate
expatriates arrived in New Orleans between 1765 and
1768. Within a century they had multiplied to forty
times that number, spreading over the entire western
part of the State.</p>

<p>Much of the temperament, the gaiety, the sensitiveness
of New Orleans comes from the Creole. He was
Latin enough to be a good deal of a gambler, to love
beautiful women, and on slight provocation to draw his
sword.</p>

<p>The street names of New Orleans&mdash;not only those of
the French Quarter, but of the whole city&mdash;reflect his
various tastes. Many of the streets bear the names of
historic figures of the French and Spanish r&eacute;gimes;
Rampart Street, formerly the rue des Ramparts marks,
like the outer boulevards of Paris, the line of the old city
wall. Other streets were given pretty feminine names
by the old Creole gallants: Suzette, Celeste, Estelle,
Angelie, and the like. The devout doubtless had their
share in the naming of Religious Street, Nuns Street,
Piety Street, Assumption Street, and Amen Street.
The taste for Greek and Roman classicism which developed
in France at the time of the Revolution, found
its way to Louisiana, and is reflected in New Orleans by
streets bearing the names of gods, demi gods, the muses
and the graces. The pronunciation given to some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
these names is curious: Melpomene, instead of being
given four syllables is called Melpomeen; Calliope is
similarly Callioap; Euterpe, Euterp, and so on. This,
however, is the result not of ignorance, but of a slight
corruption of the correct French pronunciations, the
Americans having taken their way of pronouncing the
names from the French. The Napoleonic wars are
commemorated in the names of Napoleon Avenue, and
Austerlitz and Jena Streets, and the visit of Lafayette in
the naming for him of both a street and an avenue. But
perhaps the most striking names of all the old ones were
Mystery Street, Madman's Street, Love Street (Rue de
l'Amour), Goodchildren Street (Rue des Bons Enfants),
and above all those two streets in the Faubourg Marigny
which old Bernard Marigny amused himself by naming
for two games of chance at which, it is said, he had
lost a fortune&mdash;namely Bagatelle and Craps&mdash;the latter
not the game played with dice, but an old-time game of
cards.</p>

<p>The French spoken by cultivated Creoles bears to the
French of modern France about the same relation as the
current English of Virginia does to that of England.
Creole French is founded largely upon the French of
the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, just as
many of the so-called "Americanisms" of older parts of
the country, including Virginia and New England, are
Elizabethan. The early English and French colonists,
coming to this country with the language of their times,
dropped, over here, into a linguistic backwater. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
mother countries language continued to renew itself as
it flowed along, by elisions, by the adoption and legitimatizing
of slang words (as for instance the word
"cab," to which Dean Swift objected on the ground that
it was slang for "cabriolet"), and by all the other means
through which our vocabularies are forever changing.
But to the colonies these changes were not carried, and
such changes as occurred in the French and English of
America were, for the most part, separate and distinct
(as exampled by such Creole words as "banquette" for
"sidewalk," in place of the French word <i>trottoir</i>, and
the word "baire," whence comes the American term
"mosquito bar.") The influence of colloquial French
from Canada may also be traced in New Orleans, and
the language there was further affected by the strange
jargon spoken by the Creole negro&mdash;precisely as the
English dialect of negroes in other parts of the South
may be said to have affected the speech of all the
Southern States.</p>

<p>Between the dialect of the Louisiana Cajan and that
of the French Canadian of Quebec and northern New
York there is a strong resemblance; but the Creole negro
language is a thing entirely apart, being made up, it is
said, partly from French and partly from African word
sounds, just as the "gulla" of the South Carolina coast
is made up from African and English. The one is no
more intelligible to a Frenchman than the other to a
Londoner. The ignorant Creole negro wishing to say
"I do not understand," would not say "moi je ne com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>prends
pas," but "mo pas connais"; similarly for "I am
going away," he does not say, "je m'en vais," but "ma
pe couri"; while for "I have a horse," instead of "j'ai
un cheval," he will put the statement, "me gany&eacute; choue."
It is a dialect lacking mood, tense, and grammar.</p>

<p>To this day one may occasionally see in New Orleans
and in other lower river towns an old "mammy" wearing
the bandanna headdress called a <i>tignon</i>, which, toward
the end of the eighteenth century, was made compulsory
for colored women in Louisiana. The need for
some such distinguishing racial badge was, it is said,
twofold. Yellow sirens from the French West Indies,
flocking to New Orleans, were becoming exceedingly
conspicuous in dress and adornment; furthermore one
hears stories of wealthy white men, fathers of octoroon
or quadroon girls, who sent these illegitimate daughters
abroad to be educated. The latter, one learns from
many sources, were very often beautiful in the extreme,
as were also the Domingan girls, and history is full of
the tales of the curious, wild, fashionably caparisoned,
declass&eacute; circle of society, which came to exist in New
Orleans through the presence there of so many alluring
women of light color and equally light character. Some
of these women, it is said, could hardly be distinguished
from brunette whites, and it was largely for this reason
that the <i>tignon</i> was placed by law upon the heads of
all women having negro blood.</p>

<p>No morsels from the history of old New Orleans are
more suggestive to the imagination than the hints we get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
from many sources of wildly dissipated life centering
around the notorious quadroon balls&mdash;or as they were
called in their day, <i>cordon bleu</i> balls. An old guide book
informs me that the women who were the great attraction
at these functions were "probably the handsomest
race of women in the world, and were, besides, splendid
dancers and finished dressers." Authorities seem to
agree that these balls were exceedingly popular among
the young Creole gentlemen, as well as with men visiting
the city, and that duels, resulting from quarrels over
the women, were of common occurrence. If a Creole
had the choice of weapons slender swords called <i>colichemardes</i>
were used, whereas pistols were almost invariably
selected by Americans. Duels with swords were
often fought indoors, but when firearms were to be employed
the combatants repaired to one of the customary
dueling grounds. Under the fine old live oaks of the
City Park&mdash;then out in the country&mdash;it is said that as
many as ten duels have been fought in a single day.
Duels having their beginnings at the quadroon balls
were, however, often fought in St. Anthony's Garden,
for the ballroom was in a building (now occupied by a
sisterhood of colored nuns) which stands on Orleans
Street, near where it abuts against the Garden. This
garden, bearing the name of the saint whose temptations
have been of such conspicuous interest to painters of the
nude, is not named for him so much in his own right, as
because he was the patron of that same Padre Antonio
de Sedella, already mentioned, who came to New Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>leans
to institute the Inquisition, but who, after having
been sent away by Governor Miro, returned as a secular
priest and became much beloved for his good works.
Padre Antonio lived in a hut near the garden, and it is
he who figures in Thomas Bailey Aldrich's story "P&egrave;re
Antoine's Date Palm."</p>

<p>To the Creole, more than to any other source, may be
traced the origin of dueling in the United States, and no
city in the country has such a dueling history as New
Orleans. The American took the practice from the
Latin and by the adoption of pistols made the duel a
much more serious thing than it had previously been,
when swords were employed and first blood usually constituted
"satisfaction." Up to the time of the Civil
War the man who refused a challenge became a sort of
outcast, and I have been told that even to this day a
duel is occasionally fought. Governor Claiborne, first
American governor of Louisiana, was a duelist, and his
monument&mdash;a family monument in the annex of the old
Basin Street division of St. Louis cemetery&mdash;bears upon
one side an inscription in memory of his brother-in-law,
Micajah Lewis, "who fell in a duel, January 14, 1804."</p>

<p>Gayarr&eacute;, in his history of Louisiana, tells a story of
six young French noblemen who, one night, paired off
and fought for no reason whatever save out of bravado.
Two of them were killed.</p>

<p>Two famous characters of New Orleans, about the
middle of the last century, were Major Joe Howell, a
brother-in-law of Jefferson Davis, and Major Henry, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
dare-devil soldier of fortune who had filibustered in
Nicaragua and fought in the Mexican War. One day
while drinking together they quarreled, and as a result
a duel was arranged to take place the same afternoon.
Henry kept on drinking, but Howell went to sleep and
slept until it was time to go to the dueling ground, when
he took one cocktail, and departed.</p>

<p>Feeling that a duel over a disagreement the occasion
for which neither contestant could remember, was the
height of folly, friends intervened, and finally succeeded
in getting Major Henry to say that the fight could be
called off if Howell would apologize.</p>

<p>"For what?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know and don't care," returned the old warrior.</p>

<p>As Howell would not apologize, navy revolvers were
produced and the two faced each other, the understanding
being that they should begin at ten paces with six
barrels loaded, firing at will and advancing. At the
word "Fire!" both shot and missed, but Howell cocked
his revolver with his right thumb and fired again immediately,
wounding Henry in the arm. Henry then
fired and missed a second time, while Howell's third shot
struck his antagonist in the abdomen. Wounded as he
was, Henry managed to fire again, narrowly missing the
other, who was not only a giant in size, but was a conspicuous
mark, owing to the white clothing which he
wore. At this Howell advanced a step and took steady
aim, and he would almost certainly have killed his op<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>ponent
had not his own second reached out and thrown
his pistol up, sending the shot wild. This occurred
after the other side has cried "Stop!"&mdash;as it had been
agreed should be done in case either man was badly
wounded. A foul was consequently claimed, the seconds
drew their pistols, and a general battle was narrowly
averted. After many weeks Henry recovered.</p>

<p>A great number of historic duels were over politics.
Such a one was the fight which took place in 1843, between
Mr. Hueston, editor of the Baton Rouge "Gazette"
and Mr. Alcee La Branche, a Creole gentleman
who had been speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives,
and was running for Congress. Mr. La
Branche was one of the few public men in the State
who had never fought a duel, and in the course of a violent
political campaign, Hueston twitted him on this subject
in the columns of the "Gazette," trying to make him
out a coward. Soon after the insulting article appeared,
the two men met in the billiard room of the old
St. Charles Hotel, and when La Branche demanded an
apology, and was refused, he struck Hueston with a
cane, or a cue, and knocked him down. A duel was, of
course, arranged, the weapons selected being double-barreled
shotguns loaded with ball. At the first discharge
Hueston's hat and coat were punctured by bullets.
He demanded a second exchange of shots, which
resulted about as before&mdash;his own shots going wild,
while those of his opponent narrowly missed him.
Hueston, however, obstinately insisted that the duel be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
continued, and the guns were loaded for the third time.
In the next discharge the editor received a scalp wound.
It was now agreed by all present that matters had gone
far enough, but Hueston remained obdurate in his intention
to kill or be killed, and in the face of violent protests,
demanded that the guns again be loaded. The
next exchange of shots proved to be the last. Hueston
let both barrels go without effect, and fell to the ground
shot through the lungs. Taken to the Maison de Sant&eacute;,
he was in such agony that he begged a friend to finish
the work by shooting him through the head. Within
a few hours he was dead.</p>

<p>The old guide book from which I gather these items
cites, also, cases in which duels were fought over trivial
matters, such, for instance, as a mildly hostile newspaper
criticism of an operatic performance, and an argument
between a Creole and a Frenchman over the
greatness of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Professor Brander Matthews tells me of an episode in
which the wit exhibited by a Creole lawyer, in the course
of a case in a New Orleans court, caused him to be challenged.
The opposing counsel, likewise a Creole, was
a great dandy. He appeared in an immaculate white
suit and boiled shirt, but the weather was warm, and
after he had spoken for perhaps half an hour his shirt
was wilted, and he asked an adjournment. The adjournment
over, he reappeared in a fresh shirt, but this
too wilted presently, whereupon another adjournment
was taken. At the end of this he again reappeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
wearing a third fresh shirt, and in it managed to complete
his plea.</p>

<p>It now became the other lawyer's turn. He arose
and, speaking with the utmost gravity, addressed the
jury.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said (Professor Matthews tells it in
French), "I shall divide my speech into three shirts."
He then announced: "First shirt"&mdash;and made his first
point. This accomplished, he paused briefly, then proclaimed:
"Second shirt," and followed with his second
point. Then: "Third and last shirt," and after completing
his argument sat down. The delighted jury
gave him the verdict, but his witticism involved him in
a duel with the worsted advocate. The result of this
duel Professor Matthews does not tell, but if the wag's
<i>colichemarde</i> was as swift and penetrating as his wit,
we may surmise that his opponent of the Code Napol&eacute;on
and the code duello had a fourth shirt spoiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVIII" id="CHAPTER_LVIII"></a>CHAPTER LVIII<br />
<br />
FROM ANTIQUES TO PIRATES</h2>


<p>The numerous antique shops of the French quarter,
with their gray, undulating floors and their
piled-up, dusty litter of old furniture, plate,
glass, and china, and the equally numerous old book
stores, with their piles of French publications, their
shadowy corners, their pleasant ancient bindings and
their stale smell, are peculiarly reminiscent of similar
establishments in Paris.</p>

<p>That Eugene Field knew these shops well we have reason
to know by at least two of his poems. In one, "The
Discreet Collector," he tells us that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down south there is a curio shop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown to many men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat do I intend to stop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am South again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The narrow street through which to go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aha! I know it well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maybe you would like to know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no&mdash;I will not tell!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But later, when filled with remorse over his extravagance
in "blowing twenty dollars in by nine o'clock <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span>,"
he reveals the location of his favorite establishment,
saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Royal Street (near Conti) there's a lovely curio shop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, one balmy fateful morn, it was my chance to stop&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So that, at least, is the neighborhood in which he
learned that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The curio collector is so blindly lost in sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he doesn't spend his money&mdash;he simply blows it in!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his verses called "Doctor Sam," Field touched on
another fascinating side of Creole negro life: the mysterious
beliefs and rites of voodooism&mdash;or, as it is more
often spelled, voudouism.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago it used to be possible for a visitor
with a "pull" in New Orleans to see some of the
voudou performances and to have "a work made" for
him, but the police have dealt so severely with those who
believe in this barbarous nonsense, that it is practised in
these times only with the utmost secrecy.</p>

<p>Voudouism was brought by the early slaves from the
Congo, but in Louisiana the negroes&mdash;probably desiring
to imitate the religion of their white masters&mdash;appropriated
some of the Roman Catholic saints and made
them subject to the Great Serpent, or <i>Grand Zombi</i>, who
is the voudou god. These saints, however, are given
voudou names, St. Michael, for example, being <i>Blanc
Dani</i>, and St. Peter, <i>Papa Liba</i>. This situation is the
antithesis of that to be found in Brittany, where Druidical
beliefs, handed down for generations among the
peasants, may now be faintly traced running like on odd
alien threads through the strong fabric of Roman Catholicism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span></p>

<p>Voudouism is not, however, to be dignified by the
name "religion." It is superstition founded upon
charms and hoodoos. It is witchcraft of the maddest
kind, involving the most hideous performances. Moreover,
it is said that a hoodoo is something of which a
French negro is very much afraid, and that his fear is
justifiable, for the reason that the throwing of a <i>wanga</i>,
or curse, may also involve the administering of subtle
poisons made from herbs.</p>

<p>Legend is rich with stories of Marie Le Veau, the
voudou queen, who lived long ago in New Orleans, and
of love and death accomplished by means of voudou
charms. Charms are brought about in various ways.
Among these the burning of black candles, accompanied
by certain performances, brings evil upon those against
whom a "work" is made, while blue candles have to do
with love charms. It may also be noted that "love
powders" can be purchased now-a-days in drug stores
in New Orleans.</p>

<p>In the days of long ago the great negro gathering
place used to be Congo Square&mdash;now Beauregard
Square&mdash;and here, on Sunday nights, wild dances used
to occur&mdash;the "bamboula" and "calinda"&mdash;and sinister
spells were cast. Later the voudous went to more secluded
spots on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, and
on St. John's Eve, which is their great occasion, many
of the whites of the city used to go to the lake in hopes
of discovering a voudou s&eacute;ance, and being allowed to
see it. A friend of mine, who has seen several of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
s&eacute;ances, says that they are unbelievably weird and horrible.
They will make a gombo, put a snake in it, and
then devour it, and they will wring a cat's neck and drink
its blood. And of course, along with these loathsome
ceremonies, go incantations, chants, dances, and frenzies,
sometimes ending in catalepsis.</p>

<p>There are weird stories of white women of good family
who have believed in voudou, and have taken part in
the rites; and there are other tales of evil spells, such as
that of the Creole bride of long ago, whose affianced had
been the lover of a quadroon girl, a hairdresser. The
hairdresser when she came to do the bride's hair for the
wedding, gave her a bouquet of flowers. The bride
smelled the bouquet&mdash;and died at the church door.</p>

<p>It was, I think, in an old book store on Royal Street&mdash;or
else on Chartres&mdash;that I found the tattered guide
book to which I referred in an earlier chapter. It was
"edited and compiled by several leading writers of the
New Orleans Press," and published in 1885, and it contains
an introductory recommendation by George W.
Cable&mdash;which is about the finest guarantee that a book
on New Orleans can have.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable, of course, more than all the rest of the people
who have written of New Orleans put together,
placed the city definitely in literature. And it is interesting,
if somewhat saddening, to recall that for lifting
the city into the world of belles lettres, for adorning it
and preserving it in such volumes as "Old Creole Days,"
"The Grandissimes," "Madame Delphine," and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
valuable, truthful, and charming works, he was roundly
abused by his own fellow-townsmen. Far from attacking
Mr. Cable, New Orleans ought to build him a monument,
and I am glad to say that, though the monument is
not there yet, the city does seem to have come to its
senses, and that the prophet is no longer without honor
in his own country.</p>

<p>Some further leaves are added to the literary laurels
of the city by what Thomas Bailey Aldrich has written
of it, and the wreath is made the greater by the fact that
in New Orleans was born "the only literary man in New
York," Professor Brander Matthews.</p>

<p>Another distinguished name in letters, connected with
the place, is that of Lafcadio Hearn, who was at one
time a reporter on a New Orleans newspaper, and who
not only wrote about the French quarter, but collected
many proverbs of the Creoles in a book which he called
"Gombo Zebes." In his little volume, "Chita," Hearn
described the land of lakes, bayous, and <i>ch&ecirc;ni&egrave;res</i>, which
forms a strip between the city and the Gulf, and which,
with its wild birds, wild scenery, and wild storms, and its
extraordinary population of hunters and fishermen&mdash;Cajuns,
Italians, Japanese, Spanish, Kanakas, Filipinos,
French, and half-breed Indians, all intermarrying&mdash;is
the strangest, most outlandish section of this country
I have ever visited. The Filipinos, who introduced
shrimp fishing in this region, building villages on stilts,
like those of their own islands, were not there when
Hearn wrote "Chita," nor was Ludwig raising <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>diamond-back
terrapin on Grand Isle, but the live-oaks, draped
with sad Spanish moss, lined the bayous as they do to-day,
and the alligators, turtles and snakes were there,
and the tall marsh grass, so like bamboo, fringed the
banks as it does now, and water hyacinth carpeted the
pools, and the savage tropical storms came sweeping in,
now and then, from the Gulf, flooding the entire country,
tearing everything up by the roots, then receding,
carrying the floating debris back with them to the salt
sea. One has to see what they call a "slight" storm, in
that country, to know what a great storm there must be.
Hearn surely saw storms there, for in "Chita" he
describes with terrifying vividness that historic tempest
which, in 1856, obliterated, at one stroke, Last Island,
with its fashionable hotel and all the guests of that hotel.
I have seen a "little" thunderstorm in Barataria Bay
and I do not want to see a big one. I have seen brown
men who, in the storm of 1915 (which did a million dollars'
worth of damage in New Orleans), floated about
the Baratarias for days, upon the roofs of houses, and I
have seen little children, half Italian, half Filipino, who
were saved by being carried by their parents into the
branches of an old live-oak, where they waited until good
Horace Harvey, "the little father of the Baratarias,"
came down there in his motor yacht, the <i>Destrehan</i>,
rescued them, warmed them, fed them, and gave them
back to life. I was told in New Orleans that there were
ten seconds in that storm when the wind reached a velocity
of 140 miles per hour at the mouth of the Missis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>sippi,
that it blew for four hours at the rate of 90 miles,
and that the lowest barometrical reading ever recorded
in the United States (28.11) was recorded in New Orleans
during this hurricane.</p>

<p>Of the summer climate of New Orleans I know nothing
at first hand, and judging from what people have
told me, that is all I want to know. The winter climate
suited me very well while I was there, although the boast
that grass is green and roses bloom all the year round,
does not imply such intense heat as some people may
suppose. Furthermore, I believe that the thermometer
has once or twice in the history of the city dropped low
enough to kill any ordinary rose, for a friend of mine
told me a story about some water pipes that froze and
burst during an unprecedented cold snap which occurred
some years ago. He said that an English colonel, whom
he knew, was visiting the city at the time and that, finding
himself unable to get water in his bathtub, he sent out
for several cases of Apollinaris, and with true British
phlegm proceeded to empty them into the tub and get
in among the bubbles.</p>

<p>Still another figure having to do with literature, and
also with the history of New Orleans, is Jean Lafitte,
known as a pirate, whose life is said to have inspired
Byron's poem, "The Corsair." There was a time, long
ago, when Lafitte, together with his brother, his
doughty lieutenant, Dominique You, and his rabble of
Baratarians, caused New Orleans a great deal of annoyance,
but like many other doubtful characters, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
have, since their death, become entirely picturesque, and
the very idea that Lafitte was not a first-class blood-and-thunder
pirate is as distasteful to the people of New Orleans
to-day, as his being any kind of a near-pirate at
all, used to be to their ancestors. Nevertheless Frank
R. Stockton, who made a great specialty of pirates, says
of Lafitte: "He never committed an act of piracy in
his life; he was [before he went to Barataria] a blacksmith,
and knew no more about sailing a ship or even
the smallest kind of a boat than he knew about the
proper construction of a sonnet.... It is said of him
that he was never at sea but twice in his life: once when
he came from France, and once when he left this country,
and on neither occasion did he sail under the Jolly
Roger." According to Stockton, Lafitte, when he gave
up his blacksmith shop (in which he is said to have made
some of the fine wrought iron balcony railings which
still adorn the old town), and went to Barataria, became
nothing more nor less than a "fence" for pirates
and privateers, taking their booty, smuggling it up to
New Orleans, and selling it there on commission.</p>

<p>But if the fact that he was not a gory-handed freebooter
is against Lafitte, there is one great thing in
his favor. When the British were making ready to
attack New Orleans in 1814, they tried both to bribe and
to browbeat Lafitte into joining forces with them. As
the American government was planning, at this very
time, a punitive expedition against him, it would perhaps
have seemed good policy for the pseudo-pirate to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
have accepted the British offer, but what Lafitte did was
to go up and report the matter at New Orleans, giving
the city the first authentic information of the contemplated
attack, and offering to join with his men in the
defense, in exchange for amnesty.</p>

<p>A good many people, however, did not believe his
story, and a good many others thought it beneath the
dignity of the government to treat with a man of his
dubious occupation. Therefore poor Lafitte was not
listened to, but, upon the contrary, only succeeded in
stirring up trouble for himself, for an expedition was
immediately sent against him; his settlement at Barataria&mdash;on
the gulf, about forty miles below the city&mdash;was
demolished and the inhabitants driven to the woods
and swamps.</p>

<p>But in spite of this discouraging experience, Lafitte
would not join the British, and it came about that when
the Battle of New Orleans was about to be fought,
Andrew Jackson, who had a short time before referred
to Lafitte and his men as a band of "hellish banditti,"
was glad to accept their aid. Dominique You&mdash;with
his fine pirate name&mdash;commanded a gun, and the others
fought according to the best piratical tradition. After
the battle was won, the Baratarians were pardoned by
President Madison. Incidentally it may be remarked
here that the American line of defense on the plains of
Chalmette, below the city, had been indicated some years
before by the French General Moreau, hero of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>Hohenlinden,
as the proper strategic position for safeguarding
New Orleans on the south.</p>

<p>Even after he had been pardoned, Lafitte felt, not
without some justice, that he had been ill-used by the
Americans, and because of this he determined to leave
the country. He set sail with a band of his followers
for other climes, but what became of them is not known.
Some think their ship went down in a storm which
crossed the Gulf soon after their departure; others believe
that they reached Yucatan, and that Lafitte died
there. Whatever his fate, he did not improve it by
departing from New Orleans, for had he not done so
he would, at the end, have been given a handsome burial
and a nice monument like that of Dominique You&mdash;which
may be seen to this day in the old cemetery on
Claiborne Avenue, between Iberville and St. Louis
Streets.</p>

<p>Having disposed of literary men and pirates, we now
come in logical sequence to composers and actors. Be
it known, then, that E.&nbsp;H. Sothern first raised, in the
house at 79 Bienville Street, the voice which has
charmed us in the theater, and that Louis Gottschalk,
composer of the almost too well-known "Last Hope," was
also born in New Orleans.</p>

<p>The records of the opera and the theater might, in
themselves, make a chapter. As early as 1791 a French
theatrical company played in New Orleans, using halls,
and in 1808 a theater was built in St. Philip Street. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
is said that the first play given in the city in English was
performed December 24, 1817, the play being "The
Honey Moon," and the manager Noah M. Ludlow; but
it was not until some years later that the English drama
became a feature of the city's life, with the establishment
of a stock company under the management of
James H. Caldwell. Edwin Forrest appeared, in 1824,
with Mr. Caldwell's company at the Camp Street Theater,
which he built on leaving the Orleans Theater. The
former was, when opened, out in the swamp, and people
had to walk to it from Canal Street on a narrow path
of planks. It was the first building in the city to be
lighted by gas.</p>

<p>The annals of the old St. Charles theater, called "old
Drury," are rich with history. Practically all our
great players from 1835 until long after the Civil War,
appeared in this theater, and an old prompter's book
which, I believe, is still in existence, records, among
many other things, certain details of the appearance
there, in 1852, of Junius Brutus Booth, father of Edwin
Booth, and mentions also that Joseph Jefferson (Sr.)
then a young man, was reprimanded for being noisy in
his dressing-room.</p>

<p>New Orleans was, I believe, the first American city
regularly to support grand opera and to give it a home.
For a great many years before 1859 (in which year
the present French Opera House on Bourbon Street was
built) there was a regular annual season of opera at
the Orleans Theater, long since destroyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days of the city's operatic grandeur great singers
used to visit New Orleans before visiting New York,
as witness, for example, the d&eacute;but at the French Opera
House of Adelina Patti. Since the time of the Civil
War, however, the city has suffered a decline in this
department of art. Opera seasons have not been regular,
and in spite of occasional attempts to revive the
old-time spirit, the ancient Opera House, with its brave
columned front, its cracking veneer of stucco, and its
surrounding of little vari-colored one story caf&eacute;s and
shops (which are themselves like bits of operatic scenery),
does not so much suggest to the imagination a
home of modern opera, as a mournful mortuary chapel
haunted by the ghosts of old half-forgotten composers:
Herold, Spontini, Mehul, Varney; old conductors, long
since gone to dust: Prevost, John, Calabresi; old arias
of Meyerbeer, Auber, and Donizetti; and above all, by
the ghosts of pretty pirouetting ballerinas, and of great
singers whose voices have, these many years, been still.</p>

<p>An old lady who knew Louisiana in the forties and
fifties, has left record of the fact that plantation negroes
used to know and sing the French operatic airs, just as
the Italian peasants of to-day know and sing the music
of Puccini and Leoncavallo. But if opera no longer
reaches the negro, it cannot be said that it has failed to
leave its stamp on the French quarter. From open windows
and doors, from little shops and half-hidden courtyards,
from shuttered second story galleries, there comes
floating to the ears of the wayfarer the sound of music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
In one house a piano is being played with dash; in another
a child is practising her scales; from still another
comes a soprano voice, the sad whistling of a flute, the
tinkle of a guitar, or the anguished squeal of a tortured
violin. Never except in Naples have I heard, on one
block, so many musical instruments independently at
work, as in some single blocks of the <i>vieux carr&eacute;</i>; and
never anywhere have I seen a sign which struck as more
expressive of the industries of a locality, than that one
which I saw near the house of Mme. Lalurie, which
read: "Odd Jobs Done, and Music."</p>

<p>The reason for this musical congestion is twofold.
Not only is the Creole a great lover of good light music,
but the whole region for blocks about the Opera House
is populated by old musicians from the opera's orchestra,
and women, some middle aged, some old, who used
to be in the ballet or the chorus, and who not only keep
alive the musical tradition of the district, but pass it on
to the younger generation. Indeed there are almost as
many places in the French quarter where music may be
heard, as where stories are told.</p>

<p>In one street may be seen a house where the troubles
with the Mafia began. On a corner&mdash;the southeast
corner of Royal and St. Peter&mdash;is shown the house in
which Cable's "'Sieur George" resided. This house is,
I believe, the same one which, when erected, caused people
to move away from its immediate neighborhood, for
fear that its height would cause it to fall down. It
is a four story house&mdash;the first built in the city. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
southeast corner of Royal and Hospital Streets stands
that "haunted" house of Mme. Lalaurie, who fled the
town when indignation was aroused because of devilish
tortures she inflicted on her slaves. This house is
now an Italian tenement, but even in its decay it will be
recognized as a mansion which, in its day, was fit to
house such guests as Louis Philippe, Lafayette, and Ney.
A guest even more distinguished than these, was to have
been housed in the mansion at the northeast corner of
St. Louis and Chartres Streets, for the Creoles had a
plan to rescue Napoleon from St. Helena and bring him
here, and had this house prepared to receive him.</p>

<p>And are we to forget where Andrew Jackson was entertained

beverage, containing opalescent dreams? Shall
we not go to Sazerac's for a cocktail, or to Ramos' for

<br />
ANTOINE'S AND MARDI GRAS</h2>


<p>Antoine's is to me one of the four or five most
satisfactory restaurants in the United States,&mdash;two
of the others being the Louisiane and Galatoire's.
But one has one's slight preferences in these
things; and just as I have a feeling that the cuisine of the
Hotel St. Regis in New York surpasses, just a little bit,
that of any other eating place in the city, I have a feeling
about Antoine's in New Orleans. This is not, perhaps,
with me, altogether a culinary matter, for whereas I
remember delightful meals at the Louisiane and Galatoire's&mdash;meals
which, indeed, could hardly be surpassed&mdash;I
lived for a week at Antoine's, and felt at home there,
and became peculiarly attached to the quaint, rambling
old restaurant, up stairs and down.</p>

<p>Antoine's has never been "fixed up." The caf&eacute; makes
one think of such old Parisian restaurants as the Boeuf
&agrave; la Mode, or the Tour d'Argent. Far from being a
showy place, it is utterly simple in its decorations and
equipment, but if there is in this country a restaurant
more French than Antoine's, I do not know where that
restaurant is.</p>

<p>Antoine Alciatore, founder of the establishment, de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>parted
nearly forty years ago to the realms to which
great chefs are ultimately taken. Coming from France
as a young man he established himself in a small caf&eacute;
opposite the slave market, where he proceeded to cook
and let his cooking speak for him. His dinde &agrave; la Talleyrand
soon made him famous, and he prospered, moving
before long to the present building. His sons, Jules and
Fernand, were sent to Paris to learn at headquarters the
best traditions of the haute cuisine, doing service as
apprentices in such establishments as the Maison d'Or
and Brabant's. Jules is now proprietor of Antoine's,
while Fernand is master of the Louisiane.</p>

<p>The two brothers are of somewhat different type.
Fernand is, above all, a chef; I have never seen him outside
his own kitchen. His son, Fernand Jr., superintends
the front part of the Louisiane, which he has
transformed into a place having the appearance of a
New York restaurant. The young man has made a
successful bid for the fashionable patronage of New
Orleans, and there is dancing in the Louisiane in the
evening. Jules, upon the other hand, is perhaps more
the director than his brother Fernand&mdash;more the suave
delightful host, less the man of cap and apron. Jules
loves to give parties&mdash;to astonish his guests with a brilliant
dinner and with his unrivaled grace as g&eacute;rant.
That he is able to do these things no one is better aware
than my companion and I, for it was our good fortune
to be accepted by Jules as friends and fellow artists.</p>

<p>Never while my companion and I lived at Antoine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
did we escape the feeling that we were not in the United
States, but in some foreign land. To go to his rooms
he went upstairs, around a corner, down a few steps,
past a pantry, and a back stairway by which savory
smells ascended from the kitchen, along a latticed gallery
overlooking a courtyard like that of some inn in
Segovia, along another gallery running at right angles
to the first and overlooking the same court, including
the kitchen door and the laundry, and finally to a chamber
with French doors, a canopied bed, and French windows
opening upon a balcony that overlooked the side
street. His room was called "The Creole Yacht," while
mine was the "Maison Vert."</p>

<p>I remember a room in that curious little hotel opposite
the Caf&eacute; du D&ocirc;me, in Paris (the hotel in which it is said
Whistler stayed when he was a student), which almost
exactly resembled my room at Antoine's, even to the
dust which was under the bed&mdash;until 'G&eacute;nie got to work
with broom and brush. Moreover, connected with my
room there was a bath which actually had a <i>chaufbain</i>
to heat the water: one of those weird French machines
resembling the engine of a steam launch, which pops
savagely when you light the gas beneath it, and which,
as you are always expecting it to blow up and destroy
you, converts the morning ablutions from a perfunctory
duty into a great adventure.</p>

<p>Then too, there was Marie who has attended to the
<i>linge</i> at Antoine's for the last fifty years, and who helped
the gray-haired genial Eug&eacute;nie to "make proper the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
rooms." Ever since 'G&eacute;nie&mdash;as she is called, for short&mdash;came
from her native Midi, she has been at Antoine's;
and like Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;the gentle, kindly, white-mustached
old waiter who, when we were there, had just moved up
to Antoine's after thirty-five years' service at the Louisiane&mdash;'G&eacute;nie
is always ready with a smile; yes, even in
the rush of Mardi Gras!</p>

<p>Antoine's does not set up to be a regular hotel, and we
stopped there because, during the carnival, all rooms in
the large modern hotels across Canal Street were taken.
The carnival rush made room-service at Antoine's a little
slow, now and then; sometimes the bell would not be
answered when we rang for breakfast; or again, our
morning coffee and <i>croissants</i> would be forty minutes
on the way; sometimes we became a little bit impatient&mdash;though
we could never bring ourselves to say so to
such amiable servitors. As a result, when we were leaving
the city for a little trip, we determined to stay, on
our return, at the Grunewald, a hotel like any one of a
hundred others in the United States&mdash;marble lobbies,
gold ceilings, rathskellers, cabaret shows, dancing, and
page boys wandering through the corridors and dining-rooms,
calling in nasal, sing-song voices: "<i>Mis</i>-ter
<i>Shoss</i>-futt! <i>Mis</i>-ter <i>Ahm</i>-kaplopps! <i>Mis</i>-ter <i>Praggle</i>-fiss!
<i>Mis</i>-ter Blahms!"</p>

<p>We did return and go to the Grunewald. But comfortable
as we were made there, we had to own to each
other that we missed Antoine's. We missed our curious
old rooms. I even missed my <i>chaufbain</i>, and was bored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
at the commonplace matutinal performance of turning
on hot water without preliminary experiments in marine
engineering. We thought wistfully of 'G&eacute;nie's patient
smile, and of her daily assurance to us, when we went
out, that "when she had made the apartments she
would render the key to the bureau, <i>alors</i>,"&mdash;which is to
say, leave the key at the office. We yearned for the
caf&eacute;, for good Fran&ccedil;ois, for the deliciously flavored oysters
cooked on the half-shell and served on a pan of hot
rock-salt which kept them warm; for the cold tomatoes
<i>&agrave; la Jules C&eacute;sar</i>; for the bisque of crayfish <i>&agrave; la Cardinal</i>;
for the bouillibasse (which Thackeray admitted was as
good in New Orleans as in Marseilles, and which Otis
Skinner says is better); for the unrivaled gombo <i>&agrave; la
Cr&eacute;ole</i>, and pompano <i>en Papillotte</i>, and pressed duck <i>&agrave;
la Tour d'Argent</i>, and orange Brul&ocirc;t, and the wonderful
Caf&eacute; Brul&ocirc;t Diabolique&mdash;that spiced coffee made in a
silver bowl from which emerge the blue flames of burning
cognac, and in honor of which the lights of the caf&eacute;
are always temporarily dimmed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">The lights are always lowered at Antoine&#39;s when the spectacular Caf&eacute; Boulot Diabolique is served</span>
</div>

<p>Nor least of all was it that we wished to see again the
mother of Jules, who sits back of the <i>caisse</i> and takes in
the money, like many another good French wife and
mother&mdash;a tiny little old lady more than ninety-five
years old, who came to New Orleans in 1840 as the bride
of the then young Antoine Alciatore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="p656jpg" id="p656jpg"></a>
<img src="images/p656.jpg" width="600" height="452" alt="The little lady who sits behind the desk is more than ninety-five years old, and came to New Orleans as the

<span class="caption">The little lady who sits behind the desk is more than ninety-five years old, and came to New Orleans as the

</div>

<p>So we put on our hats and coats when evening came,
and went back to Antoine's for dinner, and as long as
we were in New Orleans we kept on going back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span></p>

<p>That is not to say, of course, that we did not go also
to the Louisiane and Galatoire's, or that we did not drop
in for luncheon, sometimes, at Brasco's, in Gravier
Street, or at Kolb's, a more or less conventional German
restaurant in St. Charles Street; or that we failed to go
out to Tranchina's at Spanish Fort, on Lake Pontchartrain,
or to the quainter little place called Noy's where, we
learned, Ernest Peixotto had been but a short time before,
gathering material for indigestion and an article
in "Scribner's Magazine." But when all is said and
done there remain the three restaurants of the old quarter.</p>

<p>I should like to give some history of Galatoire's as
well as of the other two, but when I asked the <i>patron</i> for
the story of his restaurant, he smiled, and with a shrug
replied: "But Monsieur, the story is in the food!"</p>

<p>Do not expect any of these places to present the brilliant
appearance of distinguished New York restaurants.
They are comparatively simple, all of them, and
are engaged not with soft carpets and gilt ceilings, but
with the art of cookery.</p>

<p>I have been told that some of them have what may be
termed "tourist cooking," which is not their best, but if
you know good food, and let them know you know it, and
if you visit them at any time except during the carnival,
then you have a right to expect in any one of these establishments,
a superb dinner. For as I once heard my
friend Col. Beverly Myles, one of the city's most distinguished
<i>gourmets</i>, remark: "To talk of 'tolerably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
good food' in a French restaurant is like talking of 'a
tolerably honest man.'"</p>

<p>The carnival of Mardi Gras and the several days preceding,
is one of those things about which I feel as I do
concerning Niagara Falls, and gambling houses, and
the red light district of Butte, Montana, and the underground
levels of a mine, and the world as seen from an
a&euml;roplane, and the Quatres Arts ball, and a bull fight&mdash;I
am glad to have seen it once, but I have no desire to
see it again. During the carnival my companion and
I enjoyed a period of sleepless gaiety. To be sure, we
went to bed every morning, but what is the use in doing
that if you also get up every morning? We went to the
street pageants, we went to the balls at the French
Opera House, we saw the masking on the streets,
and when the carnival was finished we were finished,
too.</p>

<p>The great thing about the carnival, it seems to me, is
that it bears the relation to the life of the city, that a
well-developed hobby does to the life of an individual.
It keeps the city young. It keeps it from becoming
pompous, from taking itself too seriously, from getting
into a rut. It stimulates not alone the young, but the
grave and reverend seigniors also, to give themselves
up for a little while each year to play, and moreover to
use their imaginations in annually devising new pageants
and costumes. From this point of view such a carnival
would be a good thing for any city.</p>

<p>But that is where the Latin spirit of New Orleans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
comes in, with its pleasing combination of gaiety and
restraint. You could not hold such a carnival in every
city. You could not do it in New York. For more important
even than the pageants and the balls, is the carnival
frame of mind. To hold a carnival such as New
Orleans holds, a city must know how to be lively and
playful without becoming drunk, without breaking barroom
mirrors, upsetting tables, annoying women, thrusting
"ticklers" into people's faces, jostling, fighting, committing
the thousand rough vulgar excesses in which
New York indulges every New Year's Eve, and in which
it would indulge to an even more disgusting extent under
the additional license of the mask.</p>

<p>The carnival&mdash;<i>carne vale</i>, farewell flesh&mdash;which terminates
with Mardi Gras&mdash;"Fat Tuesday," or Shrove
Tuesday, the day before the beginning of Lent&mdash;comes
down to us from pagan times by way of the Latin countries.
The "Cowbellions," a secret organization of Mobile,
in 1831 elaborated the idea of historical and legendary
processions, and as early as 1837 New Orleans held
grotesque street parades. Twenty years later the
"Mystic Krewe," now known as "Comus," appeared
from nowhere and disappeared again. The success of
Comus encouraged the formation of other secret societies,
each having its own parade and ball, and in 1872,
Rex, King of the Carnival, entered his royal capital of
New Orleans in honor of the visit of the Grand Duke
Alexis&mdash;who, by the way, is one of countless notables
who have feasted at Antoine's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span></p>

<p>The three leading carnival societies, Comus, Momus,
and Proteus, are understood to be connected with three
of the city's four leading clubs, all of which stand within
easy range of one another on the uptown side of Canal
Street: the Boston Club (taking its name from an old
card game); the Pickwick (named for Dickens' genial
gentleman, a statue of whom stands in the lobby); the
Louisiana, a young men's club; and the Chess, Checkers
and Whist Club. The latter association is, I believe, the
one that takes no part in the carnival.</p>

<p>Each of the carnival organizations has its own King
and Queen, and the connection between certain clubs
and certain carnival societies may be guessed from
the fact that the Comus Queen and Proteus Queen
always appear on the stand in front of the Pickwick
Club, to witness their respective parades, and that
the Queen of the entire Carnival appears with her
maids of honor on the stand before the Boston Club
upon the day of Mardi Gras, to witness the triumphal
entry and parade of Rex. As Rex passes the club he
sends her a bouquet&mdash;the official indication of her queenship.
That night she appears for the first time in the
glory of her royal robes at the Rex Ball, which is held
in a large hall; and the great event of the carnival, from
a social standpoint, is the official visit, on the same night,
of Rex and his Queen, attended by their court, to
the King and Queen of Comus, at the Comus Ball, held
in the Opera House.</p>

<p>Passing between the brilliantly illuminated flag-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>draped
buildings, under festoons of colored electric
lights, the street parades, with their spectacular colored
floats, their bands, their negro torch-bearers, their
strangely costumed masked figures, throwing favors
into the dense crowds, are glorious sights for children
ranging anywhere from eight to eighty years of age.
Public masking on the streets, on the day of Mardi Gras,
is also an amusing feature of the carnival.</p>

</div>

<p>The balls, upon the other hand, are social events of
great importance in the city, and as spectacles they are
peculiarly fine. Invitations to these balls are greatly
coveted, and the visitor to the city who would attend
them, must exert his "pull" some time in advance.
The invitations, by the way, are not sent by individuals,
but by the separate organizations, and even those
young ladies who are so fortunate as to have "call-outs"&mdash;cards
inclosed with their invitations, indicating that
they are to be asked to dance, and may therefore have
seats on the ground floor&mdash;are not supposed to know
from what man these cards come. Ladies who have not
received call-outs, and gentlemen who are not members
of the societies, are packed into the boxes and seats above
the parquet floor, and do not go upon the dancing floor
until very late in the evening. Throughout each ball
the members of the society giving the ball continue to
wear their costumes and their masks, so that ladies,
called from their seats to dance, often find themselves
treading a measure with some gallant who speaks
in a strange assumed voice, striving to maintain the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
mystery of his identity. The ladies, upon the other
hand, are not in costume and are not masked; about
them, there is no more mystery than women always
have about them. After each dance the masker produces
a present for his partner&mdash;usually a pretty bit
of jewelry. Etiquette not only allows, but insists, that
a woman accept any gift offered to her at a carnival
ball, and it is said that by this means many a young
gentleman has succeeded in bestowing upon the lady of
his heart a piece of jewelry the value of which would
make acceptance of the gift impossible under other than
carnival conditions.</p>

<p>After the balls many of the younger couples go to the
Louisiane and Antoine's, to continue the dance, and as
my room at Antoine's was directly over one of the dancing
rooms of the establishment, I might make a shrewd
guess as to how long they stayed up, after my companion
and I retired.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that we retired early. I remember
well the look of the pale blue dawn of Ash
Wednesday morning, and no less do I remember a conversation
with a gentleman I met at the Louisiane, just
before the dawn broke. I never saw him before and I
have never seen him since; nor do I know his name, or
where he came from. I only know that he was an
agreeable, friendly person who did not wish to go to
bed.</p>

<p>When I said that I was going home he protested.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" he urged. "There's a nice French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
restaurant in this town. I can't think of the name of
it. Let's go there."</p>

<p>"Well, how can we go if you don't know what place
it is?" I asked, intending to be discouraging.</p>

<p>The young man looked dazed at this. Then his face
brightened suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he cried. "I remember the name now!
It's the Louisiane! Come on! Let's get our coats an'
go there!"</p>

<p>"But," I said, "this is the Louisiane right here."</p>

<p>The thought seemed to stagger him, for he swayed
ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, regarding me with great solemnity.
"Let's go there!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have wondered since if this same young man may
not have been the one who, returning to the St. Charles
Hotel in the early hours of that sad Ash Wednesday
morning, was asked by the clerk, who gave him his key,
whether he wished to leave a call.</p>

<p>"What day's this?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Wednesday," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"All ri'," replied the other, moving toward the elevator.
"Call me Saturday."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span></p>

<p>It is good to look about the world; but always there
comes a time when the restless creature, man, having
yielded to the call of the seas and the stars and
the sky, and gone a-journeying, begins to think of home
again. Even were home a less satisfactory, a less happy
place than it is, he would be bound to think of it after
so long a journey as that upon which my companion and
I had spent so many months. For, just as it is necessary
for a locomotive to go every so often for an overhauling,
so it is necessary for the traveler to return to
headquarters. The fastenings of his wardrobe trunk
are getting loose, and the side of it has been stove in;
his heels are running down in back, his watch needs
regulating, his umbrella-handle is coming loose, he is
running out of notebooks and pencils and has broken a
blade of his knife in trying to open a bottle with it
(because he left his corkscrew in a hotel somewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
along the way). His fountain pen has sprung a leak
and spoiled a waistcoat, his razors are dull, his strop
is nicked, and he has run out of the kind of cigarettes
and cigars he likes. One lens of his spectacles has
gotten scratched, his mail has ceased to reach him, his
light suits are spotted, baggy and worn, and his winter
suits are becoming too heavy for comfort as the spring
advances. His neckties are getting stringy, he has
hangnails and a cough; he never could fix his own hangnails,
and he cannot cure his cough because the bottle
of glycerine and wild cherry provided for just such an
emergency by the loved ones at home, got broken on the
trip from Jacksonville to Montgomery, and went dribbling
down through the trunk, ruining his reference
books, three of his best shirts, and the only decent pair
of russet shoes he had left. The other shoes have been
ruined in various ways; one pair was spoiled in a possum
hunt at Clinton, North Carolina&mdash;and it was worth it,
and worth the overcoat that was ruined at the same
time; two pairs of black shoes have been caked up with
layers and layers of sticky blacking, and one pair of
russets was ruined by a well intentioned negro lad in
Memphis, who thought they would look better painted
red. His traveler's checks are running low and he is
continually afraid that, amid his constantly increasing
piles of notes and papers, he will lose the three books in
each of which remains a few feet of "yellow scrip"&mdash;the
mileage of the South&mdash;which will take him on his return
journey as far as Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is that all. The determining factor in his decision
to go home lies in the havoc wrought by a long
succession of hotel laundries&mdash;laundries which starch
the bosoms of soft silk shirts, which mark the owner's
name in ink upon the hems of sheer linen handkerchiefs
which already have embroidered monograms, which rip
holes in those handkerchiefs and then fold them so that
the holes are concealed until, some night, he whips one
confidently from the pocket of his dress suit, and reveals
it looking like a tattered battle-flag; laundries which
leave long trails of iron rust on shirt-bosoms, which rip
out seams, tear off buttons, squeeze out new standing
collars to a saw-tooth edge, iron little pieces of red and
brown string into collars, cuffs, and especially into the
bosoms of dress shirts, and "finish" dress shirts and
collars, not only in the sense of ending their days of usefulness
as fast as possible, but also by making them shine
like the interiors of glazed porcelain bathtubs. But the
greatest cruelty of the hotel laundry is to socks. It is
not that they do more damage to socks, than to other
garments, but that the laundry devil has been able to
think of a greater variety of means for the destruction
of socks than for the destruction of any other kind of
garment. He begins by fastening to each sock a cloth-covered
tin tag, attached by means of prongs. On this
tag he puts certain marks which will mean nothing to
the next laundry. The next laundry therefore attaches
other tin tags, either ripping off the old ones (leaving
holes where the prongs went through) or else letting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
them remain in place, so that, after a while, the whole
top of the sock is covered with tin, making it an extraordinarily
uncomfortable thing to wear, and a strange
thing to look at. There is still another way in which
the laundry devil tortures the sock-owner. He can find
ways to shrink any sock that is not made of solid heavy
silk; and of course he can rip silk socks all to pieces.
He will take silk-and-wool socks of normal length, and
in one washing will so reduce them that you can hardly
get your foot into them, and that the upper margins
of them come only about an inch above your shoe-tops.
People who have no business to do so, are thus enabled,
when you are seated, to see the tops of your socks and to
amuse themselves by counting the tin tags with which
they are adorned. Also, the socks, being so short, become
better pullers than the garters, so that instead of
the garters holding the socks up, the socks pull the
garters down. This usually occurs as you are walking
up the aisle in church, or in the middle of a dance, and
of course your garter manages to come unclasped, into
the bargain, and goes trailing after you, like a convict's
ball and chain.</p>

<p>For a time you can stand this sort of thing, but presently
you begin to pine for the delicate washtub artistry
of Amanda, at home; for vestments which, when sent to
the wash, do not come back riddled with holes, or smelling
as though they had been washed in carbolic acid, or
in the tub with a large fish.</p>

<p>So, presently, you fold up your rags like the Arabs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>
fasten your battered baggage shut as best you can, put
it on a taxi, and head for the railway station. No train
ever looks so handsome as the home-bound train you find
there. No engineer ever looks so sturdy and capable,
leaning from the window of his cab, as the one who is to
take you home.</p>

<p>Up through the South you fly, past many places you
have seen before, past towns where you have friends
whom you would like to see again&mdash;only not now! Now
nothing will do but home! Out of the region of magnolias,
palmettoes and live-oaks you pass into the region
of pines, and out of the region of pines into that of
maples and elms. At last you come to Washington....
Only a few hours longer! How satisfyingly
the train slips along! You are not conscious of curves,
or even of turning wheels beneath you. Your progress
is like the swift glide of a flying sled. Baltimore, Wilmington,
Philadelphia, Trenton. Nothing to do but
look from the car windows and rejoice. Not that you
love the South less, but that you love home more.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we will ever go on such a trip as this
again?" you say to your companion.</p>

<p>"I don't believe so," he replies.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem now as though we should," you return.
"But do you remember?&mdash;we talked the same
way when we were coming home before. What will it
be two years hence?"</p>

<p>"True," he says. "And of course there's Conan
Doyle. He always thinks he's never going to do it any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
more. But in a year or so Sherlock Holmes pops out
again, drawn by Freddy Steele, all over the cover of
'Collier's.' Not that your stuff is as good as Doyle's,
but that the general case is somewhat parallel."</p>

<p>"Doyle has killed Holmes," you put in.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agrees, "and several times you've almost
killed me."</p>

<p>Then as the train speeds scornfully through Newark,
without stopping, he catches sight of a vast concrete
building&mdash;a warehouse of some kind, apparently.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cries. "Isn't it wonderful?"</p>

<p>"That building?"</p>

<p>"Not the building itself. The thought that we don't
have to get off here and go through it. Think what it
would be like if we were on our travels! There would
be a lot of citizens in frock coats. Probably the mayor
would be there, too. They would drive us to that building,
and take us in, and then they would cry if we refused
to go to the fourteenth floor, where they keep the
dried prunes."</p>

<p>The train slips across the Jersey meadows and darts
into the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Now," he remarks hopefully, "we are really going
to get home&mdash;if this tunnel doesn't drop in on us."</p>

<p>And when the train has emerged from the tunnel, and
you have emerged from the train, he says: "Now
there's no doubt that we are going to get home&mdash;unless
we are smashed up in a taxi, on the way."</p>

<p>And when the taxi stops at your front door, and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
bid him farewell before he continues on his way to his
own front door, he says: "Now you're going to get
home for sure&mdash;unless the elevator drops."</p>

<p>And when the elevator has not dropped, but has transported
you in safety to the door of your apartment, and
you have searched out the old key, and have unlocked the
door, and entered, and found happiness within, then you
wonder to yourself as I once heard a little boy wonder,
when he had gone out of his own yard, and had found a
number of large cans of paint, and had upset them on
himself:</p>

<p>"I have a very happy home," he said, reflectively. "I
wonder why I don't seem to stay around it more?"</p>

was sunk by the Union forces when they abandoned Norfolk. A Confederate
captain, John M. Brooke, raised her, equipped her with a ram,
and covered her with boiler plate and railroad rails. She is called the
first ironclad. While she was being reconstructed John Ericsson was
building his <i>Monitor</i> in New York. The turret was first used on this
vessel. It is worth noting that at the time of the engagement between
these two ships the <i>Monitor</i> was not the property of the Federal Government,
but belonged to C.&nbsp;S. Bushnell, of New Haven, who built her at
his own expense, in spite of the opposition of the Navy Department of
that day. The Government paid for her long after the fight. It should also
be noted that the <i>Merrimac</i> did not fight under that name, but as a Confederate
ship had been rechristened <i>Virginia</i>. The patriotic action of Mr.
Bushnell is recalled by the fact that, only recently, Mr. Godfrey L. Cabot,
of Boston, has agreed to furnish funds to build the torpedoplane designed
by Admiral Fiske as a weapon wherewith to attack the German fleet

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
